#Arch Rivals not supported in MAME
[arch-riv]
Arch Rivals contained a feature to customize the team names and colors in this game.
(Brian Peek)

Arch Rivals used the same 49-way "pseudo-analog" joystick Sinistar used.
(Mike Cuddy)
.

[arkatayt]
This is the bootleg version of Arkanoid by Taito. This version is missing the microcontroller present on the original game.
.

[armora]
Designed and programmed by Tim Skelly

One of two games Skelly did for Cinematronics that had *required* overlay backgrounds. Warrior was the other one. Skelly designed six vector games and programmed five of them while at Cinematronics.
.

[asteroid]
Designed by Lyle Rains
Programmed by Ed Logg

Originally called Cosmos, the original design was a copy of Space Wars, except with asteroids littering the playfield as an asthetic effect.
(Brian Deuel)

Asteroids was the first game to have a top ten high score field.
(Peter Hirschberg)
.

[astdelux]
Designed by Ed Logg & Lyle Rains
Programmed by Dave Shepperd

This game was created out of modified Asteroids code.  At the same time this game was  being produced,  Space Duel was in the works,  but was shelved as Asteroids Deluxe was green-lighted for production. This game did poorly, and Atari later released Space Duel to moderate success.
.

[barrier]
Designed and programmed by Rob Patton

The second programmer hired by Tim Skelly, Rob was only 17 when he joined Cinematronics. This game is very reminiscent of the old Mattel handheld football games from the late 70's.  The gameplay is not as deep, though :)
.

[bzone]
Designed by Morgan Hoff and Ed Rotberg
Programmed by Ed Rotberg and Jed Margolin

Battlezone was the first environmental 3D landscape game. The game used a system of bit-slice processors called a "mathbox" to do 3D calculations for the display. This kind of "squeezing the most out of minimal hardware" mindset was what led Atari to create the innovative games it did in the 1980's.

Battlezone was so innovative for its time, the US Army commissioned Atari to create a version of the game for infantry vehicle training. Ed Rotberg was assigned the project, but was very opposed to it.

It is questionable whether the US Army versions were ever produced,  but it is rumored that Videotopia (the traveling video games exhibit) has one in their possession.

The volcano erupting in the background was created by Owen Rubin (Major Havoc). Rubin pestered Rotberg to add the volcano, but he was too busy to write the code, and told Rubin that if he wanted the erupting volcano, he'd have to write the code. The next morning, Rotberg walked in to a volcano erupting onscreen and the code listing on his desk.
.

[berzerk]
Designed and programmed by Alan McNeil

The title of this game comes from the series of books called The Berzerker Stories by Fred Saberhagen.

Berzerk was originally designed for the 6809E CPU, until it was discovered that the processor didn't work properly. The board was then redone to run on a Z80.  The speech was done using LPC coding, which cost $1,000 per word to compress at that time. The game also originally had a monochrome monitor; when Defender was released in color, the company reconsidered their display approach and redesigned the display using a color overlay board.

Evil Otto was named for Dave Otto, who worked for Dave Nutting's Arcade Engineering group as R & D director at the time Alan McNeil did. Each Berzerk unit was "autographed" by the designer.
.

[bwidow]
Designed and programmed by Bruce Merritt

This game was a conversion kit for Gravitar, when that game flopped badly.  Although it was a fun game, Black Widow didn't do much better.
.

[blstroid]
Designed and programmed by Ed Rotberg and crew.

The asteroids used were digitized lava rocks,  some of which were painted white. Industrial Light and Magic was commissioned to build models of the five player ships, which were then photographed in various positions and digitized. The game was originally to have areas in which a certain ship form was required to get through them, but the game's production was pushed forward,  and it didn't get the tuning originally planned.
.

[boothill]
Designed and programmed by Dave Nutting and crew

The sequel to Gunfight, which was designed on TTL-based hardware by Taito, which was adapted to 8080 hardware by Nutting, to be the first coin-op to run on microprocessor-based hardware (phew!).
#
#This is the oldest game emulated by Retrocade.
#
.

[bosco]
Bosconian was famous for it's two major firsts: first game to feature multi-directional scrolling; and first game to have a continue feature. When the game was released, Midway gave out strategy booklets to the game from a display attached to the machine.
.

[boxingb]
Designed and programmed by Jack Ritter

One of the last vector games Cinematronics made; very few numbers were produced, and Cinematronics' days were numbered. They would make a brief comeback with Dragon's Lair, but shortly afterwards disappear into oblivion.
.

[bubbles]
Designed by Python Angelo and John Kotlarik
Programmed by Tim Murphy

"What I was trying to do with Bubbles was come up with a non-violent, clean game," (no pun intended) says John Kotlarik. One of two games that had a duramold cabinet available (the other is Blaster).
(Curtis Hart)
.

[btime]
The original Data East version hardware had a cassette module so games could be converted easily and quickly. Unfortunately, the cassettes were prone to breakage, and the systems were quickly junked. When Bally Midway licensed the game from DECO, they replaced the hardware with a dedicated hardware system.
.

[centiped]
Designed and programmed by Dona Bailey and Ed Logg

The first coin-op game designed by a woman. A grasshopper was in the original design,  but was later removed from the game. Like Pacman,  this game has special appeal to women.
(Eric Gorka)
.

[cloak]
Designed and programmed by Russell "Rusty" Dawe

Originally called Agent-X, this game was renamed to coincide with the release of the 1984 movie of the same name.
.

#[crater]

[crush]
Crush Roller is a bootleg of Williams Electronics' game Make Trax.
.

[ccastles]
Designed and programmed by Scott Fuller and Franz Lanzinger

Originally called Toperoids, this game was originally a 3D Asteroids variant, in which asteroids and other objects fell from the sky, endangering the player.  The enemies coming down from the top of the screen was an artifact from the original concept.
(Videotopia)
.

[defender]
Designed and programmed by Eugene Jarvis, Larry DeMar, Sam Dicker, and Paul Dussault

The macho man's game!!

Defender was noted for its sound and visual effects, and extremely hard gameplay. That didn't stop players from racking up millions of points on the game.

Literally minutes from the opening of the AMOA Jarvis and his team were burning new ROMs for the display game due to the fact they plugged the first burn into the board backwards and fried them! Due to the intimidating controls, no one played the game and were even rumors saying Pac Man and Defender would bomb and Rally-X would be the next hit. Time Magazine did an interview with Peter Juraszek who was 'Defender Champion' after playing it for over 16 hours straight on 1 quarter.

Not only did Defender have the most buttons to use during gameplay (It had 5 buttons, plus a joystick) but it was also the first game to have events occur outside of the players main screen.
(Curtis Hart, Brian Deuel)
.

[destderb]
Designed and programmed by Arcade Engineering

Demolition Derby came in a two-player upright cabinet and a four-player flat table that players stood around.
.

[demon]
Demon was created on Cinematronics' vector hardware by Rock-Ola.
.

[digdug]
Designed by Namco Japan

Dig Dug was the NOT the first game that Atari licensed from Namco Ltd,  as is common belief. That honor goes to TX-1,  the "3D" racing game that projected a race track on a screen using a rolling film.
.

[dotron]
Designed and programmed by John Pasierb, Bill Adams, George Gomez, Atish Ghosh, and Earl Vickers

Discs of Tron was originally designed to be a part of the original Tron coin-op, but was cut out at the end, and set aside for refinement and release as a stand-alone coin-op in its own right.
.

[domino]
Designed by Arcade Engineering, whose crazy imaginations created some of the most original game concepts of the 80's.
.

[dkong]
Designed by Shigeru Miyamoto

First multi-screened game. Was a quick replacement for an excess stock of cabinets for a poor game called Radarscope. Mario WAS given his name in the original Donkey Kong game.(Some believe he wasn't named Mario until DK Jr). In Donkey Kong, Mario's career was a carpenter.
(Curtis Hart)
.

[dkongjr]
Designed by Shigeru Miyamoto
.

[fantasy]
Fantasy was licensed for production in the US by Rock-Ola.
.

[foodf]
Food Fight was designed for Atari by General Computing as part of a lawsuit settlement for an illegal speedup kit for Missile Command, in which they affixed their copyright. This was one of two games; Quantum was the other.
(Brian Deuel)

Inspired by the food fight scene in National Lampoon's Animal House.
(Curtis Hart)
.

[atarifb]
Designed and partially programmed by Steve Bristow
Finished by Ed Logg, Lyle Rains, and Dave Stubbens

This game was first created in 1974 and originally called X's and O's. It was shelved when Bristow started on Tank, then resurrected three years later. First game with a trackball controller.
.

[frenzy]
Designed and programmed by Alan McNeil

Frenzy is the sequel to Berzerk. Added features include the ability to shoot your own exits, and the ability to kill Evil Otto. Finally!!
.

[frogger]
Frogger was licensed for production in the US by Sega.

Another game that catered to the ladies, Frogger was a big success, and spawned many ports for home systems.
.

[galaga]
Midway licensed this game from Namco, Ltd., for manufacture in the US.

Galaga is the sequel to Galaxian, which was the first RGB color game. Although Galaga was a superior game, it didn't sell the large numbers that it's predecessor did.
.

[galaxian]
Galaxian was the first RGB color coin-op game. Midway licensed the game for manufacture in the US.
.

[gravitar]
Designed and programmed by Mike Hally

Gravitar was a collossal failure, but its designer would go on to greater heights by helping design Star Wars. Hally's recent programming credits include Gauntlet Legends.
.

[gyruss]
Designed and programmed by Yoshiki Okamoto

After designing Time Pilot, Okamoto did Gyruss, which, although a hit, came out at a time when the arcade craze was dying down. Therefore, it didn't sell the numbers it so rightly deserved. Okamoto asked for a raise, or he would quit. The next day, when he showed up for work, he was informed he was fired. Okamoto is now executive producer at Capcom, where he has designed Sonson, Gunsmoke, 1942, 1943, Sidearms, and was project leader for Final Fight and Street Fighter II.

Gyruss is most often remembered for its fine musical score that plays throughout the game. (Bach's "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor"). The sound portion of the game uses 5 GI-AY8910 sound chips to generate the music and sound effects.

Thanx to Till Oldemeyer for the information.

[journey]
Designed and programmed by Elaine and Richard Ditton

Used digitized faces of the band members, photographed with a camera designed by Ralph Baer, father of the home video game console. The machine contained a tape loop of the song "Separate Ways (World's Apart)" in the concert scene at the end of each level.
.

[joust]
Designed by John Newcommer
Programmed by Bill "Pfutz" Pfutzenreuter

Joust was the first "platform" game (rather, game with platforms). The early machines had a bug that allowed a player to rack up millions of points by standing on the middle platform and killing pteradactyls endlessly, or until the player got tired and gave up.
.

[kick]
Designed and programmed by John Pasierb and crew

Originally a monochrome game called Catch 40, Kickman was shelved for three years until it was taken down and refined.
.

#[klax]

[llander]
Designed by someone, somewhere on a PDP-11
Programmed by Rich Moore

Atari's first vector game. After a short run of Lunar Lander machines were manufacturered, production was shifted over to Asteroids, and the first few hundred Asteroids machines were housed in Lunar Lander cabinets.
.

#[lrescue]

[mhavoc]
Designed and programmed by Owen Rubin and Mark Cerny (Marble Madness)

Gameplay innovation at its finest. A game that would have done greater numbers had anyone cared in 1984. Only 500-600 dedicated machines were manufactured.
.

[maxrpm]
Max RPM is known best for it's split-screen play, but not much else :)
.

[missile]
Designed and programmed by Dave Theurer (Tempest)

Originally called Armeggedon, Missile Command was designed at a time that the United States and Russia were locked in a fierce "cold war". The idea began when Lyle Rains received a clipping of a magazine story about satellites. He passed this article on to Dave Theurer who then designed the game. Dave says work on the game became so intense, he had nightmares of impending nuclear holocaust on a regular basis.
.

[mooncrst]
Many clones were made of this game. Among them: Eagle, Moon Quasar, and Fantasia. This game did quite well when it was released, but signaled the end of the space game rush.
.

[mspacman]
When Midway needed a sequel to the greatest selling video game of all time, Namco was not yet ready to deliver it, as Super Pacman was still in development. Therefore, Midway opted to design the sequel in-house, and Ms. Pacman was born.
.

[mspacatk]
This is a hack of Ms. Pacman done by Two-Bit Score, who also did Popeye Pacman.
.

[nibbler]
First game to support a billion point score.
(Curtis Hart)
.

[omegrace]
Designed and programmed by Ron Halliburton and crew

Midway's only vector game.

Omega Race was designed as a direct competitor to Atari's Asteroids.
.

[pacman]
Designed by Toru Iwantani
Programmed by Hideyuki Mokajima and crew

Pacman was conceived at lunchtime...literally. The designer was very hungry, and ordered a whole pizza for himself. He took one slice, and Pacman was born.

The name Pacman is derived from the Japanese slang word "paku-paku", which means "to eat". The game was called "Puckman" in Japan, but due to American's predilection with changing words to vulgarities by scratching part of the word off (Puck to..well, you know), it was changed to Pacman.

To give the game some tension, some clever AI was programmed into the game. The ghosts would group up, attack the player, then disperse. Each ghost had its own AI. Blinky chases Pacman, Pinky is positioned a few dots in front of Pacman's mouth. The others move randomly.

The game took 1 1/2 years to complete, and had five people on its team.

Pacman is the greatest selling arcade game of all time, and is arguably the most well-known video character. It had its own cartoon, lunch box, board game, and hundreds of other products. Pacman was also the first game to have a "character", and changed the face of video games forever.

Pacman was the first video game to be as equally popular to women as it was with men.

(Thanks to Jeff Mercer for the Iwatani interview transcript, from which most of this trivia was taken.)

[phoenix]
Phoenix was the first multi-level space shooter, preceding Gorf.

#[pballoon]

[piranha]
Piranha is a hack of Pacman that was released in the arcades as a conversion kit. No lawsuit was ever filed against GL for the conversion.
.

[pleiads]
Pleiads' marquee on the actual machine has the spelling 'Pleiades' instead of the on-screen spelling.
.

[powerdrv]
Designed by John Kubik
Programmed by Jeff Nauman and crew
.

[quantum]
Quantum was designed by General Computer Corp. for Atari as part of a lawsuit settlement for a Missile Command speedup kit to which they affixed their copyright. Quantum was one of the games, Food Fight was the other.

Quantum was a conversion kit for Space Duel and Gravitar.
.

[rampage]

[redbaron]
Red Baron was a conversion kit for Battlezone. The game did poorly in the arcades.
.

[mhavocrv]
Modifications of original by Jess Askey

Return To Vax is a hack of Major Havoc. Changes include new levels and easier gameplay.
.

[ripoff]
Designed and programmed by Tim Skelly

Skelly's name appears on Reactor, another one of his designs. Tim was one of the first independent game designers.
.

[robotron]
Designed and programmed by Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar (Vidkidz)

The design of Robotron was influenced by Berzerk and the Commodore PET game Chase. The prototype of the game was built on a Defender platform with a Stargate board and two Atari 2600 joysticks attached to a pail. Jarvis came up with the control design after breaking his hand in an automobile accident.
.

[rbtapper]
Designed and programmed by Steve Meyer.
.

[sarge]
Designed and programmed by Arcade Engineering

Hidden deep inside the graphics roms is a risque' version of the woman shown at the beginning of the game. An easter egg, perhaps?
.

[shollow]
Designed and programmed by Arcade Engineering, who designed a slew of games for Midway before being bought out by them in 1985.
.

[scramble]
Licensed from Konami by Stern

Called the poor man's Defender, this was one of the first multi-level space shooters, if not the first.
.

[sinistar]
Designed and programmed by Noah Falstein, RJ Mical, John Newcommer, Jack Haegar, and Sam Dicker

Sinistar started out life as Juggernaut, then Dark Star.
(Curtis Hart)

The game's original program was changed to make it more difficult, due to management decisions that it was too easy. According to the designers, this was totally against their wishes, as it spoiled a perfect balance of gameplay and the game's smooth animation sequences. RJ Mical has the original program burned into a set of roms in his possession, so maybe someday....?

There is another version of this game available. See "Sinistar (prototype version)" for details.
.

[sinista1]
This romset is allegedly from a early release machine that was displayed at the 1982 AMOA show in Las Vegas. Two Sinistar programmers, RJ Mical and Noah Falstein, believe this to be so, but it's not confirmed.

Here's some gameplay info and differences courtesy of Sinistar page and Doug Stoffa, from whose machine these images were dumped:

1. Sinistar scream cuts off during quick re-triggers, rather than one long scream.

2. More crystals per planetoid.

3. Sinistar death sometimes occurs offscreen.

4. Warp to next level in random direction, not just upper right.

5. Some parameters in operator adjust screen not present, such as set attract mode message.

6. You don't spin out when eaten by the Sinistar.  You just explode when you get too close.

7. Once Sinistar is defeated, you do not get locked into your location on the screen.  You can move as if he were still alive.The warping direction is not random as initially thought, but is in the direction your ship is facing when the battle computer engages warp engines.

8. The set has some other weird behavior which I will call screen wrapping.  It involves enemies passing through the window of gameplay and then reappearing immediately.

9. The FIRE button advances the letter entry for high scores rather than the joystick's move-right.

10. Instead of having the word "SINISTAR" appear in red in the center of the screen in the standard font, this set has a big red word SINISTAR in the shape of the word on the marquee appear before all the standard font SINISTARs pop up.  It drips blood in a few places.

(Special thanks to Peter Freeman and Doug Stoffa.)

[snowbros]
This game was licensed by Toaplan for manufacture by Romstar.

[spacduel]
Designed and partially programmed by Owen Rubin
Finished by Rick Maurer

The original sequel to Asteroids, it was shelved when Asteroids Deluxe was green-lighted for production. When Asteroids Deluxe tanked, this game was taken off the shelf and released to moderate success.
.

[invaders]
Designed and programmed by Toshihiro Nishikado

Licensed by Midway for production in the US

The game that started the whole damn craze!! SI caused a yen shortage in Japan. Many regular produce and goods stores in Japan removed their products and converted into SI parlors overnight, complete with giant speakers broadcasting the "thump-thump-thump" of the marching invaders. A classic in every sense of the word.
(Brian Deuel)

Space Invaders was the first arcade game to work it's way out of seedy arcades and into pizza parlors and ice cream shops.
(Curtis Hart)
.

[invadpt2]
Designed and programmed by Toshihiro Nishikado

The true sequel to the original. Midway licensed a different version for US consumption (Space Invaders Deluxe).
.

[spacewar]
Original design (Spacewar!) by Steve Russell on a PDP-1 mainframe in 1962

Hardware design and game program for Cinematronics by Larry Rosenthal

Space Wars was the first vector game. Many buttons, a gigantic cabinet. The game was originally brought to Midway, but Rosenthal balked at their ridiculous royalty offer. He sold the game and hardware to Cinematronics, and signed a contract for 50% of the royalties; unheard of in those days. Rosenthal later left Cinematronics, taking all technical documents with him, and leaving poor Tim Skelly to scrounge for information. Luckily, he found a tech who had helped Rosenthal when he was pressed for time and obtained the opcodes and technical info needed. Cinematronics sued Rosenthal, but they settled, with Larry's company, Vectorbeam, being bought by Cinematronics. Looks like ol' Larry made out like a bandit!!

[spyhunt]
Designed and programmed by Bill Adams and crew

The car was based on one of the designer's own Nissan 280z.The game was to have a helicopter stage but the designers ran out of resources. They also wanted the James Bond theme to play, but settled for the Peter Gunn theme instead.
(Curtis Hart)
.

[starcas]
Designed by Tim Skelly
Programmed by Scott Boden

The star constellation in the background was actually the outline of a centerfold from a 1980 issue of OUI magazine. When management found out after shipping about 5000 units, they flipped out and almost stopped production. They eventually came to their senses and nothing was changed.
(Cameron MacMillan)
.

[starhawk]
Designed and programmed by Tim Skelly

Skelly wrote the entire Star Hawk program in pure opcodes while the development tools were being written for the board.
.

[starwars]
Designed and programmed by Mike Hally, Earl Vickers and Rick Moncrief

The basic game engine for Star Wars was converted from a 2-year old space game project called Warp-Speed, which was designed to develop 3-D image capabilities. The controls were adapted from the controls used for Army Battlezone.
(Curtis Hart)

As Luke's Tie-Fighter zooms toward the Death Star, players can barely make out the words, "May The Force Be With You" on the Death Star's face.

Star Wars was the first Atari game to have speech. All of the phrases were taken directly from the movie.

If the player hits Darth Vader's Tie Fighter 30 times, the player is awarded 255 extra shields.
(Jeff Burks)
.

[stargate]
Designed and programmed by Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar

Stargate was the first game designed by Vidkidz, the design firm founded by Jarvis and DeMar when they decided to go independent. Williams became desperate for a game after the designers left, so they took Vidkidz under contract. Stargate took four months to complete. All Vidkidz games were designed on a dual 8" floppy, 1 Mhz 6809 Motorola Exorcisor system that cost $30,000(!) in those days.
(Brian Deuel)

The name was changed to Defender II right after the game had stopped being manufactured, because Williams wanted to make sure they could own the trademark on the title.
(Curtis Hart)
.

[sundance]
Designed and programmed by Tim Skelly

Sundance had grids in space years before Tempest. Skelly felt the game lacked the anxiety element needed in a good game, and begged Cinematronics not to release it. He was right :)

.

[targ]
Many more successful games borrowed elements from Targ, but the game didn't do too well in the arcades.
.

[tempest]
Designed and programmed by Dave Theurer

Atari's first color vector game. Tempest was originally a 3-D Space Invaders clone, but was changed when the other engineers didn't come back to play the game. This was kind of a test for an Atari game; if the engineers kept coming back to play a new game, it was considered a hit. The design for Tempest came to Theurer in a dream; of tubes in space that various creatures crawled out of and attacked a shooter on top of the tube. Tempest sold 20,000 units to distributors before it was even released.

[timeplt]
Designed and programmed by Yoshiki Okamoto

Yoshiki was told to design a driving game. When he learned of the game's concept, he balked at making it, and started on Time Pilot. As development continued, Okamoto showed his boss design docs for the driving game, all the while giving code to the data-entry operators for Time Pilot. Although his boss told him to do the driving game instead, he tried to take the credit for Time Pilot. Okamoto decided not to disgrace his boss and let the episode go!!

[tron]
Designed and programmed by John Pasierb, Bill Adams, George Gomez, Atish Ghosh, and Earl Vickers

Tron was originally slated to be a color vector game. It was designed using an early script of the movie. Basically, the team took various challenges Flynn had to go through and made them into four separate games-within-a-game. Three of the four scenes were either changed or removed from the final cut of the movie, but it still made one hell of an awesome game.

[wotw]
Designed and programmed by Tim Skelly and Rob Patton

War of the Worlds was one of the last vector games Cinematronics created. The game was never released due to it testing badly at the 1982 AMOA show. The game could have been a winner had it gotten the tuning it needed, but the programmers just didn't have the hardware possible to do it justice.
.

[warrior]
Designed and programmed by Tim Skelly

Quite possibly the first fighting game ever. The game had an overlay that had the stairs and the pits that were obstacles in the game.
.

[xenophob]
Designed and programmed by Howard Shere

Xenophobe was a highly original game with a highly original concept. It was the first split-screen game. It was also a victim of a production scheduling snafu. Due to it's production being pushed ahead, a lot of the game's tuning was axed. There are many objects in the game that the player can pick up, but have no use.
