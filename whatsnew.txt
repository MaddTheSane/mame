Source Changes
--------------
Modified ledutil to save the LED state when returning from pause.
[Bob Seidel]

Fixed the crashing in debug builds and added controls for Ski Champ.
[Ville Linde]

Updated makefile to remove the map file when making clean. [Dirk Best]

Significant changes to the input system: [Derrick Renaud]
 * Added the -vol shortcut to -volume to match the docs.
 * Added new joystick options -joy_deadzone & -joy_saturation. 
    Removed -a2d_deadzone. These now apply to the analog and 
    digital-from-analog data. See windows.txt for more info.
 * Analog joystick data is divided into chunks for IPT_POSITIONAL 
    controls. e.g., for a 7 position emulated control, a joystick 
    axis will move 3 positions each way from center + center = 
    7 positions. One good use for this is 49way sticks. The driver 
    input code just needs to be set to IPT_POSITIONAL 
    PORT_POSITIONS(7) and use a PORT_REMAP_TABLE.
 * IPT_PEDAL controls are now nothing special in the core. They can 
    use any control like a paddle does. At the OS input level, the 
    code has been changed to supply full joystick axis and the +/- 
    axis. This means any half axis or full axis can be used for any 
    emulated control. e.g., a pedal that only outputs Y- data can be 
    used for the full range of the gun in boothill. Or a full axis 
    slider on a joystick can be used in its full range as an emulated 
    pedal. INC now increases the pedal value, not DEC.
 * When seting up the player controls in the menu, the first time an 
    analog joystick axis is selected it will use the full range. If 
    you immediately select the same joystick axis it will toggle to 
    the half +/- axis.
 * Analog joysticks can now simulate relative devices such as a 
    trackball. The further you move the joystick, the faster the 
    trackball spins. Use the sensitivity setting to adjust.
 * Added support for mouse +/- axis to be used as button input.
 * Modified IPT_PADDLE and IPT_AD_STICK so they do not behave as 
    pedals using half the joystick range if their default value is 
    equal to one of the PORT_MINMAX values. Now you can select it as 
    the full or +/- part axis.

Updates to the acefruit driver: [stephh]
 * added 'sidewndr' and 'spellbnd' (was 'sidewnda') which were missing 
    in previous releases
 * reorganised the layout to have all lamps and solenoids at the top 
    (where there's nothing)
 * also renamed some lamps and solenoids
 * added 'starspnr' ... unfortunately, the game is not working due 
    to a bad dump (H11)

Updated the DISCRETE_OP_AMP_OSCILLATOR circuit to get it ready for a 
future driver. It allows the DISC_OP_AMP_OSCILLATOR_1 | 
DISC_OP_AMP_IS_NORTON oscillator to use nodes to adjust the 
resistance values instead of only being static values.
[Derrick Renaud]

Fixed thrust control in Lunar Lander. [Derrick Renaud]

Created new utility module pool.c for managing memory pools. Rebuilt
auto_malloc on top of this concept. [Nathan Woods]

Added speedups to many of the Eolith games. [David Haywood]

Added sprite rotation to the realbrk driver. This fixes the jigging
reels in the pachinko games and the cue position and orientation in
the pool games.

Added discrete sound for Amazing Maze. Also added new Discrete 
modules: DISCRETE_LOOKUP_TABLE & DISCRETE_LOGIC_JKFLIPFLOP.
[Derrick Renaud]

Fixed the small graphic issues in the Cidelsa driver. Draco still has 
imperfect colors. [Curt Coder]

Fixed naming and identification of several Neo Geo ROMs. [JohnBoy]

Fixed regression in the GeeBee driver. [David Haywood]

Major update to the Konami System 573 driver: [smf]
 * added state saving to emu\sound\cdda.c & mame\drivers\ksys573.c
 * added DS2401 emulation
 * added X76F100 emulation
 * added ZS01 emulation (HLE of System 573 PIC)
 * added write support to X76F041 emulation
 * many new games partially supported

Connected brightness support on the CPS1 board (not just CPS2) after
verifying that the real board does support it. [MAME Italia forum]

Improved the K001604 tilemap chip emulation. [Ville Linde]

Fixed garbage in fonts on some systems. [Aaron Giles]

Added new tool makemeta.exe, which can generate properly formatted
metadata for laserdisc CHDs using either a specially captured AVI as
input (preferred) or a hand-crafted set of encoded Philips codes.
[Aaron Giles]

Rewrote throttling code to be more forgiving of OSD-level glitches
and uneven frame rates. [Aaron Giles]

Changed sound streaming engine to be emulated time based instead of
sample based. This means that emulation behavior is independent of
the user-specified sample rate (except that some sound cores still
use this value; to fixed in a future update). Also separated sound
generation from video frame rate. Sound is now pushed to the OSD
layer at a fixed rate of 50 updates per emulated second. This entailed
a change in the way sound is handed to the OSD layer. Instead of the 
OSD layer requesting arbitrary numbers of samples each frame, the
core now pushes the appropriate number of samples based on the
emulated time. [Aaron Giles]

Simplified the OSD interface for sound. Removed osd_start_audio_stream
and osd_stop_audio_stream; OSD initialization code is now responsible
for initialization. Removed osd_get_mastervolume and osd_sound_enable,
keeping management of the main volume in emu/sound.c. [Aaron Giles]

Changed K054539 to run at native sample rate. [Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------
Improved the cidelsa driver: [Curt Coder]
 - rewrote the cdp1802 cpu emulation as a state machine
 - fixed Draco dips and inputs (what a strange game!)
 - added NVRAM to Destroyer/Draco (Altair has no battery on the PCB)
 - fixed some clocks

Fixed mapping of spaceship controls in spcenctr. [Canim]

Removed the inclusion of unnecessary header files across the project.
[Atari Ace]

Added discrete filters to the new Namco 54xx sound effects. Also
implemented filters for the 52xx sound effects in preparation for
future changes. [Derrick Renaud]

Added pause support to the output system: [Bob Seidel]
 - added "pause" message through the Output system to let clients 
    know when MAME is paused
 - the state of an item is now sent when the item is first created
 - updated ledutil to use the pause state

Added cocktail mode and DIP locations to the Millipede driver.
[Mike Haaland]

Many more CPS2 keys added. Removed all XORs and support for them from
MAME. [Nicola Salmoria, Andreas Naive]

Fixed regression in the ar_xeon driver sprites. [Ernesto Corvi]

Kaneko driver improvements:
 - bloodwar: [Gary Walkling, Sebastien Volpe]
    * protection data extracted, still needs to be verified
    * collision detection simulation thanks to tests on real board
 - bonkadv: [Guru, Sebastien Volpe]
    * protection data fully verified: corrects tilemap colors in levels 2 and 3
    * correct implementation of MCU command 43

Fixed behavior of MOVEC instruction on later 680x0 chips, and in the
disassembler. [Ernesto Corvi]

Properly idenitified sound ROMs for Altered Beast set 2. [Brian Troha]

Fixed bad bits in a couple of FD1094 keys. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug in debugger that caused incorrect end offsets to be 
computed on CPUs with an address shift. [Ville Linde]

Moved some additional pieces of core functionality in the the core
utility library. [Nathan Woods]

Added sound to porky. [Tomasz Slanina]

Changed font scaling again. Fonts 24 pixels tall and above are scaled
the old way. Fonts smaller than that are scaled via integral scale
factors and adjusted the new way. [Aaron Giles]

Added a small optimization to the FD1094 decoding step. [Aaron Giles]

Added several new modules to the utility library libutil. First is a
generic huffman encoding module. Second is a module that allows you to
read/write AVI files in a platform-independent way. And third is a
lossless A/V compression module. These three pieces together, plus
some changes in the CHD code, allow for the creation of CHDs with
compressed audio and video. [Aaron Giles]

Added two new commands to chdman: -createav converts an AVI file in
uncompressed YUY format or HuffYUV-compressed YUY format with "left"
prediction into a CHD. And -extractav converts a CHD containing
compressed audio & video into an uncompressed YUY format AVI file.
[Aaron Giles]

Finished hooking up laserdisc support to the new audio/video 
compression. Note that we still do not have canonical CHDs of
laserdisc data at the moment, but all the support is now present for
when they start to appear. [Aaron Giles]

IMPORTANT: This release brings with it a major source code 
reorganization. Because of this, there is no diff update, since the
diff would be enormous.

The new layout at a high level looks like this:

makefile
docs/
src/
  emu/        (generic emulation files from the old src/ directory)
    cpu/      (CPU cores from src/cpu)
    sound/    (sound cores from src/sound)
    debug/    (debugger code from src/debug)
    audio/    (generic audio files from src/sndhrdw)
    layout/   (generic layout files from src/layout)
    machine/  (generic machine files from src/machine)
    video/    (generic video files from src/vidhrdw)

  mame/       (MAME-specific drivers)
    drivers/  (drivers from src/drivers)
    includes/ (includes from src/includes)
    layout/   (majority of files from src/layout)
    machine/  (majority of files from src/machine)
    audio/    (majority of files from src/sndhrdw)
    video/    (majority of files from src/vidhrdw)
    etc/      (misc files from src/etc)

  lib/        (libraries)
    util/     (various files with light dependencies from src)
    zlib/     (zlib library)
    expat/    (expat library)

  osd/        (OS-dependent code)
    osdmini/  (mini OS-dependent code)
    windows/  (Windows OS-dependent code)

  tools/      (misc tools)

Along with these changes come a number of makefile alterations to
better distribute the build knowledge within each major subdirectory.
There may be some build issues or other interesting side effects to
this change. Report them on MAMETesters and future updates will
include fixes.



MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
m4_0111u4gra [Mike Ellery]
mouser0112yel [Mamesick]
bnj0111u5ora [Canim]



Source Changes
--------------
Improvements to the Cidelsa driver: [Curt Coder]
 - Fixed the disassembly of cdp1802 opcode LSKP
 - Changed the cdp1802 opcode OUT to increment R(X) after calling the 
    write handler
 - Set cdp1869 display size and visible area according to data sheet
 - Added cdp1869 CFC emulation (probably never used by anything but 
   just for completeness' sake)
 - Cleaned up driver

Improvements to the M2 driver: [Ville Linde]
 - Added preliminary CD controller emulation
 - Hooked up some more multi-processor functionality and interrupts

Improvements to C352 sound emulator: [cync, hoot development team]
 - Rewrote loop and flag handling, added support for global key-on 
    register
 - Fixed state saving

Worked around compilation error on MSVC that caused "Calendar error"
in the Neo Geo games. [Atari Ace]

Rewrote much of the RF5C400 sound emulator to support looping, stereo
panning, and 8-bit sample support.
[hoot development team, Ville Linde]

Removed patch from mjleague now that it is not needed. 
[Arenzo Fabrice]

Fixed bubbletr crosshairs. [Canim]

Cleaned up information in mamedriv.c. [Brian Troha]

Added save state support for all games in gng.c, gunsmoke.c, lasso.c, 
solomon.c and terracre.c. [Vas Crabb]

Replaced implementation of Namco 54xx sound chip with new MB8844 CPU
core running the original embedded ROM code. Removed old sound core.
Pole Position and Bosconian no longer require samples as a result.
[Nicola Salmora, Ernesto Corvi, Guru]

Added new function driver_get_count() to return the number of drivers.
[Nathan Woods]

Added a bunch of new protection routines for SD Gundam & Heated 
Barrel. [Angelo Salese]

Input system changes: [Derrick Renaud]
 - Added new IPT_POSITIONAL control type. This is for Ikari type 
    rotary controls and gray-code devices like Seawolf. This makes 
    rotary and gray-code controls easy to enter without custom 
    handlers.
 - Fixed some rounding and min/max errors in the core input code.
 - Modified crosshair code to be based on real scaling, see Seawolf 
    for an example. It can now also have multiple crosshairs on one 
    input port if needed.
 - Added back in the namcos2 crosshairs. Turns out they are needed 
    for calibration.
 - Removed the gwar control hack from the Ikari games that did not 
    need it. Modified the gwar control hack so it is only used for 1 
    frame, making it unnoticeable.
 - Updated boothill, gunfight, seawolf, spcenctr to use the new 
    PORT_REMAP_TABLE.

Fixed the exidy/stern-sb1000 6840-based sound hardware to use what 
is believed (based on the schematic) to be the proper LFSR/PRNG 
waveform for its secondary clock source. [Lord Nightmare]

Updated Dragon Bowl to use HOLD_LINE for sound IRQs. Also did the same
for the following drivers: afega, ettrivia, funybubl, jack, mustache,
seta, trvmadns, wink. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Changed 6809/6309 CPU cores to call the MAME debugger when CWAI/SYNC
is used. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed uninitialized use of video_dma_address to address the rfjet
crash in 64-bit builds. [Ville Linde]

Added support for the Motorola MPC8240 to the PowerPC core.
[Ville Linde]

Improved ZIP file searching to look first for name + CRC match, second
for CRC-only match, and lastly for name-only match. [Ben Rudiak-Gould]

Verified and improved stepper behavior based on comparison with a
real machine. [James Wallace]

Changed file2str to work for any binary file and output the data as
an array of bytes rather than a string. [Aaron Giles]

Made UI font size computations more flexible. This ensures that fonts
are scaled vertically by an integral factor and should produce nice
proportions for most fonts now. [Aaron Giles]

Added new function sound_find_sndnum_by_tag() to look up a sound
index by its tag. [Aaron Giles]

Made osd_uchar_from_osdchar a member of the osdcore file library.
[Aaron Giles]

Created new generic bitmap management code with fewer dependencies on
the rest of MAME so that it can be used by utility code. Changed 
bitmap_alloc to always take a format parameter. Deprecated
bitmap_alloc_format. Updated all drivers to pass an explicit format
when allocating a bitmap. Changed auto_bitmap_alloc in the same
fashion. [Aaron Giles]

Split some functionality from fileio.c into new module corefile.c,
which can be used by utilities to get unicode support and fopen-style
file I/O built on top of the OSD routines. Rebuilt fileio.c on top of
the core file code. Added mame_core_file() to get the underlying
core_file object from a mame_file so it can be used with png and
xmlfile code. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the way the tiny build works. There is now the concept of a
SUBTARGET. By default SUBTARGET is set equal to TARGET (which is mame)
and everything builds as normal. The makefile that is included is now
src/$(TARGET)/$(SUBTARGET).mak. Thus, to do a tiny build, you now
have to specify "make SUBTARGET=tiny". This will produce an output 
executable with a name $(TARGET)$(SUBTARGET) (mametiny in this case).
[Aaron Giles]

Turned ENABLE_BORDER_PIX back on, since so many people seem to be
having trouble without it. [Aaron Giles]
