0.106u2
-------


IMPORTANT NOTE: The video system in this version has been completely
upended and redesigned. The old video system is still the default;
however, some features may be broken. These are not bug-worthy
reports, as the old system will soon be deprecated. The new system
can be compiled by setting the NEW_RENDER flag on in the makefile.

THE NEW SYSTEM IS STILL WORK-IN-PROGRESS! Apart from video card-
related issues (like it doesn't work on particular hardware or has
an incorrect display), bugs are not being tracked at this time.
There is already a laundry list of things that are broken at the
top of render.c, and there are many other things that still need
to be looked at.

In order to run the new video system with hardware acceleration, 
your machine will require DirectX 8 or later.

Source Changes
--------------
Added support for circular buffering in the SHARC core, and fixed
several minor bugs. [Ville Linde]

Added color PROM support for Nintendo's Sheriff driver. 
[Stefan Jokisch]

Discrete sound updates: [Derrick Renaud]
 - Typedef'ed external discrete sound structures to follow current 
     structure use. Statically defined their use in most drivers to 
     stop name pollution.
 - Created new DISCRETE_555_VCO1 module.  This is the 555&Op-amp 
    oscillator circuit used by Borderline.

Added the new video rendering system. A new file render.c contains
the bulk of the logic. Major changes include: [Aaron Giles]
 - The OSD layer is now responsible for allocating one or more 
    render_targets at osd_init time. The old osd_create_display 
    and osd_close_display calls are not used with the new system, 
    so initialization must take place at osd_init time.
 - The old osd_update_video_and_audio call has now been replaced 
    with a simple osd_update call. This update call passes a 
    mame_time to the OSD layer, which is the current emulated time. 
    Throttling and speed calculations should use this time instead
    of the framerate.
 - osd_update is responsible for calling the render system to 
    request a list of primitives to be drawn on each render_target
    for the current frame. The primitives are simple and include
    clipping rectangles, lines, and rectilinear quads only.
 - If it wishes, the OSD layer can call back to a software
    rasterizer in MAME. The rasterizer code is provided as an
    include module so it can be tuned and optimized for platform-
    specific video modes. See windows/rendsoft.c for a usage
    example.
 - There is a new layout file format .lay, which is XML-based and
    which replaces the old .art files. The .lay files describe how
    to render to a render_target. Each layout file can contain
    multiple "views", which describe one of many ways the various
    elements can be drawn. These views can be selected at runtime
    via the new "Video Options" menu.
 - The built-in UI font can be overridden with any .BDF font. Simply
    name the .BDF file "ui.bdf" and place it in the MAME directory.
    If you run at decent resolutions, you should choose a large 
    point size for this font so that the scaled results look nice.
 - The windows implementation uses Direct3D 8 as the preferred
    mechanism for rendering. By default, it will render at the
    current resolution, rather than switching resolutions as before.
    This can be changed by adding -switchres to the command line.
 - There are still a number of imperfect/incomplete features with
    the new renderer, which is why it is not on by default. An
    incomplete list is given in render.c.



New clones added

WWF: Wrestlemania (rev 1.20 08/02/95) [Corrado Tomaselli]
Heavy Smash (Asia version -4) [Corrado Tomaselli]
Mad Alien (Highway Chase) [Stefan Jokisch]



New games marked as GAME_NOT_WORKING
------------------------------------
Pasha Pasha 2 [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
Trivia Madness [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]



0.106u1
-------

IMPORTANT NOTE: Major video-related changes are beginning in the
system. Attempts will be made to keep the existing video code
working to a large degree, but some features may be broken or
working improperly until the video changes are complete. Most
notably, in this release, RGB effects are broken for non-Direct3D
blitting. For the moment, do not report anomalies or problems in 
the video system. If you like a nice, stable MAME, please stick 
with the 0.106 release. You have been warned.



MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
gladiatr0105u4gra [Don Maeby]



Source Changes
--------------
Updates to the taito_x driver: [AWJ]
 - fixed sound problems in twinhawk
 - fixed a couple of dipswitch mistakes introduced recently
 - added PORT_DIPLOCATIONs for superman and twinhawk

Improved MSVC compiler support: [Nathan Woods]
 - modified vconv to support multiple versions of MSVC based on 
    version info
 - added support for more parameter translations
 - makefile now displays compiling and linking messages when
    building vconv

Converted the Windows blitters to use the DRC engine for 
generation. RGB effects are officially broken with this change.
[Nathan Woods]

Fixed a bug that caused a crash when the -debugscript command line 
option was used with an invalid filename. [Nathan Woods]

Corrected the ordering of the DIP_PORTLOCATION() macros to be
consistent. Multi-bit DIP switches should be specified in LSB-
first order. Added a comment to this effect in inptport.h.
[AWJ, Aaron Giles]

Fixed background color in the Deco cassette games.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed potential crash in the micro3d driver. [MamePlus!]

Improvements to CHD-CD support: [R. Belmont]
 - additional RAW CD sector conversion support, so a game can request 
    e.g. 2048-byte data sectors from a RAW CHD-CD and still get the 
    right data
- reversed CHDMAN error message - now non-RAW CHD-CDs are deprecated
- susume now uses a RAW CHD-CD read directly from an original pressed 
   Konami disc

Some improvements to the Polygonet Commanders driver: [Andrew Gardner]
 - adds change_PC() calls to the dsp56k core
 - removed hacky dsp56k initialization, enabling, and disabling
 - added preliminary implementation of banking hardware tied to the 
    dsp56k in Polygonet Commanders

Fixed MSB accesses and latch reading in the 6840 emulator. [El Condor]

Improved N64 audio output: [R. Belmont]
 - rewrote Audio Interface as a stereo DMADAC (which it actually is), 
    greatly simplifying the code along the way
 - fixed AI interrupt semantics

Changed a number of games that were incorrectly using IPT_LIGHTGUN
to use IPT_AD_STICK instead. [Aaron Giles]

Some preparations for proper multiple screen support. The 
visible_area and refresh_rate values in the Machine structure are
now defined as arrays (1 per screen). The machine_config structure
has been altered as well, removing the following fields:

   frames_per_second
   aspect_x, aspect_y
   screen_width, screen_height
   default_visible_area
   vblank_duration

These are all stored per-screen in a new screen_config structure. 
[Aaron Giles]

Reorganized the user interface code to better support the new render
system. [Aaron Giles]
