Prior versions of MAME have excluded some drivers (primarily gambling-
related) for philosophical reasons. Since these games are legitimately at
risk of being lost to the ages, and many of them have strong similarities
to the other sorts of games MAME emulates, it has been decided to allow their
inclusion going forward. The criteria for inclusion in MAME is now simply
"any primarily video based arcade machine, driven by one of more CPUs," and
should relieve any confusion surrounding this issue going forward.

Source Changes
--------------
More input port cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 - Fixed input port handlers that used the port_tag_to_handler calls.
 - Simplified the reading/writing of input ports so they work more reliably.
 - Only write changed settings to the .cfg files.
 - Fixed saving of analog port configurations.

Updated to the latest zlib. [Atari Ace]

Added flipscreen to Pop Bingo. Added some disable registers for tilemaps/
sprites (fixing the bug in lastday demo). [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed some video bugs in Party Time. [David Haywood]

Adjusted Namco CUS30 noise frequency. [BUT]

Fixed input ports in djmain. [BUT]

Several Konami improvements: [R. Belmont]
 - Added support for "external memory address" registers on the YMZ280B, 
    which can be used to read the contents of attached ROM or RAM.
 - Hooked up the mask ROM tests in the service menu - both the tile 
    character ROMS and the sound ROMs now can be tested.
 - Added secondary control register.
 - Hooked up IRQ control.
 - Renamed ROMs for both games to include PCB location information.

Some improvements to the DECO cassette games: [Juergen Buchmueller]
 - Treasure Island graphics ROMs (overlay board) mapped according to
    findings by debugging the game code.
 - Swapped image names for ctislnd2 and ctislnd3 to match the driver names;
    ctislnd3 is the not yet working set; removed IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS flag.
 - Found bitswap for Zeroize type #3 dongle; found hack to get it running w/o
    the dongle ROM by debugging the game code; changed year to 1983; removed
    NOT_WORKING flag.

SHARC/Model 2 updates: [Ville Linde]
 - Reworked the SHARC internal ram implementation so that multiple instances 
    of the core work.
 - Added data address space

 - Updated Konami zr107, gticlub, nwk-tr, hornet to work with the SHARC 
    changes

Seibu SPI improvements: [Ville Linde]
 - Fixed sprite priority issues
 - Added support for pen-based alpha to sprites and tilemaps. It's currently 
    using fixed alpha table for all games, but this seems to break some 
    games, so it probably isn't correct.

Fixed the discrete sound 555 timer modules when using actual DC mode. 
[Derrick Renaud]

Added low-frequency oscillator (LFO) to YMF271 emulator. [Ville Linde]

Improvements to the dcon driver: [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
 - Fixed sprites - sprites priorities
 - Fixed sprites - tilemaps priorities
 - Added wrap around and flipy in sprites

Added MNG recording support (shift+F12 by default). [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Fixed 6309 division instructions overflow behavior on the HD6309.
[Tim Lindner]

Fixed more YMF271 issues: [Ville Linde]
 - The mix buffer pointer was not being reset between two 2-operator FM 
    sounds, causing missing sounds.
 - Fixed some bugs in the phase modulation of FM sounds

medlanes061gre [MASH]



Source Changes
--------------
Undid a hack that was accidentally left in the MCR games in the last 
release. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug in spiders that caused bad video in cocktail mode.
[Hans Andersson]

Fixed several problems in the H8/3002 core. Improves sound in Namco System 
12 and ND-1. [cync]

Fixed sound banking in Go Go! Mile Smile. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Major improvement to the YMF271 sound core: [Ville Linde]
 - Fixed timer A calculation
 - Fixed note pitch calculation
 - Added envelope generator
 - Added stereo panning and fixed other volume calculations
 - Added FM sound generation

Fixed crash in mystwarr games. [R. Belmont]

Figured out encryption key for Graplop (set 2). [MASH]

Rewrote the configuration reader/writer code to be more generic and easier
for other subsystems to plug into. This necessitated a rewrite of the way
the existing code reads config data. As a result, your game.cfg files will
be invalid after this update. Your default.cfg and existing controller-
specific .cfg files should work fine. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed all the mystwarr.c games so they pass their service mode mask ROM 
tests, with the exception of Metamorphic Force (it gets hung up on the road
generator ("LVC") test for some reason). [R. Belmont]

Fixed Monster Bash (2-board version) so it works now, though the graphics
are still not perfect. [David Haywood, MASH]

Turned off -fomit-frame-pointer in optimized builds. It was leading to 
crashes when used with setjmp/longjmp on Windows builds. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed tilemap priorities and sprites in Flying Tiger. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added green overlay to Meadows Lanes. [MASH]

Various improvements to the simple Deco 156 games: [David Haywood]
 - Modified video code to use the functions in deco16ic.c
 - Changed Osman to default to 3 buttons as per Guru's eeprom dump.

Namco System 22 update: [R. Belmont]
 - Hooked up MCU/CPU communications properly
 - The MCU now reads the controls in Prop Cycle, Alpine Racer, and 
    Cyber Cycles
 - Sound effects and music are now present in all Super System 22 games
