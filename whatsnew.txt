  switches had Freeze on by default).

- Front Line and Tin Star have the aiming dial (using a dual joystick setup).
  Also, you can now kill and be killed in Front Line. However, collision
  detection is not accurately emulated. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed ending in Robocop. [JC Alexander]

  routine, which has been completely rewritten. [Nicola Salmoria]

  [Valerio Verrando]


Source:

- Fixed a bug in the 68000 BCD emulation which caused the F1 Dream timer to
  malfunction. [Nicola Salmoria]

- New function osd_on_screen_display() to show text over the game screen.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed bug in the Z80 block I/O instructions (INI, IND, INIR, INDR, OUTI,
  OUTD, OTIR, and OTDR). [Frank Palazzolo]

- Updated the FM emulation and the way the 8910 updates its buffers. FM also
  has support for YM2608 and YM2612, though they are not compiled in.
  [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- [DOS] Rearranged the makefile using archives to work around E2BIG error on
  some machines. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Support for CRC-32 checksums instead of MAME's custom ones. The actual CRCs
  will be added later to the drivers. [John Butler]

==========================================================================
