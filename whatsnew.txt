Changes from Aaron Giles
------------------------
* removed CPU_16BIT_PORT hack; this means that all Z80 drivers must explicitly
  clamp their I/O space address space to 8-bits via ADDRESS_MAP_FLAGS(AMEF_ABITS(8))
* removed CPU_AUDIO_CPU; it was no longer having any effect, and it was a poor
  substitution for documentation since it wasn't used consistently across all games
* added 'emulator' target to the makefile to make it easier to build just mame.exe
* removed obsolete targets from the main makefile
* added Pentium-M optimization target to the makefile

  has the VBLANK-IN disactivated.

  Shanghai Triple Threat to not show correctly.
