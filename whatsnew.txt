Fixed Top Shooter sprites. Game still not playable. [Tomasz Slanina]

Changed debug view property code to pass property values as unions rather 
than void pointers, in order to appease compilers that whine about strict 
aliasing. [Nathan Woods]

[Nathan Woods]

Improved sound balance in Night Slashers. [MAME Italia]

Improvements to the Deco MLC games (added sprite buffering, fixed tile

fix). The only thing left for this driver is really raster support for 
the pitch in Stadium Hero. [Bryan McPhail]

Converted Crazy Balloon sound to use the discrete system. [Derrick Renaud]

Major Namco System 22 update: [Phil Stroffolino]
 * Hooked up the real master DSP BIOS.  Many games are now working or

    hacks as a result.
 * Hooked up the runtime-configurable interrupt handlers, removing more
    game-specific hacks.
 * Some improvements and additional documentation of video hardware.

that text doesn't get entered onto the command line. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed the handling of address masking and display within the debugger.
[Aaron Giles, Nathan Woods]

Fixed order of operations in the expression engine if functions were used.

Sync Refresh / Waitvsync / Triplebuffer changes [Alan Kamrowski II]

 * It changes the waitvsync code to wait for the beginning of the vertical
blank.  The previous code simply checked if it was in the vblank and only
waited if it wasn't.  This caused 2 problems.  The first is that when using
syncrefresh, if there was enough time, more than one frame can be rendered
during a single vblank.  This is why syncrefresh would have odd behavior
such as the game speeding up or slowing during during less cpu intensive
sequences.  The second problem is that the retrace line could sometimes be
seen because while the code checked to see if it was in the vblank, it did
not check where in the vblank it was so it might be at the end of the vblank
and by time the frame is rendered the monitor could be out of the vblank.

 * It removes the waitvsync only if game speed is above 95% restriction.
This restriction would only cause waitvsync to vacillate between on and off
depending on game speed.  If someone enables waitvsync and it is too slow,
then it is.

 * When syncrefresh and triplebuffer are used, MAME would run the waitvsync
code anyway.  The triplebuffer code takes care of this and having MAME wait
for the retrace in the waitvsync code anyway is a waste of time and causes
timing issues on some hardware.  If triplebuffering is enabled, then there
is no need to run the waitvsync code because triplebuffer already does.
