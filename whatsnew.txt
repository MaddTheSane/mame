Source Changes
--------------
Fixed regressions in Gridlee and Gomoku. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed some unicode build issues in the Windows code.
[Oliver Stoneberg]

Updated a number of games to correctly use the SN76489 instead of the
SN76496, which was a later design. [Justin Kerk, Lord Nightmare]

Cleaned up the exports from a number of drivers, adding static
qualifiers to functions and variables t hat don't need to be exported
and have generic sounding names. [Atari Ace]

Updated numerous drivers to remove the use of global Machine wherever
possible. Also reviewed the clipping regions and made changes to
ensure the passed-in cliprect was honored. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Cleaned up the Dooyong driver: [Vas Crabb]
 * Consolidated and streamlined tilemap callbacks
 * Took better advantage of MAME's tilemap caching by building 
    larger tilemaps so they don't need to be invalidated as often
 * Interpreted sprite Y position as signed 9-bit value in 
    rshark/superx (fixes some glitches)
 * Added more explanatory comments to help others reading the code 

Changed a number of mame timer objects from void * to mame_timer *.
[Atari Ace]

Fixed a couple more Irem CPU opcodes to improve Match It 2.
[Robiza]

Fixed collision detection bug in thunderX. [Shimapong]

Initial cut at working CPS3 driver. Basically works but has a lot
more work to be done to finish it up.
[David Haywood, Andreas Naive, Tomasz Slanina, ElSemi, Philip Bennett]

Fixed minor cycle timing issue in 6809 CPU core. [Ernesto Corvi]

Neo-Geo updates: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 * Fixed several regressions from previous update
 * Added LED outputs
 * Improved smaller visible area configuration

Fixed some incorrect information in the Neo Geo ROMsets. [JohnBoy]
 
Integrated platform-specific changes into the core makefile, mostly
taken from the SDLMAME makefile. Changed the MAMEOS configuration
variable to OSD, indicating which OSD layer is being compiled. Added
a new configuration variable TARGETOS which specifies the target OS 
platform. [Aaron Giles]



New clones added
----------------
Punch-Out!! (Italian bootleg) [David Haywood]

Source Changes
--------------
Fixed scanline address reporting in the qix driver. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Rewrote Neo-Geo driver again based on information from Charles
MacDonald. This update fixes a number of issues with the previous
attempt. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added support for multiple keyboards: [Andrew Kuruhin]
 - added multikeyboard input support through RAWINPUT mechanism 
    (up to 8 simultaneous keyboard inputs
 - fixed RAWINPUT device registry enumeration bugs

Fixed the reset mode in CDP1802. [Curt Coder]

Fixed a number of errors and simplified the code significantly in the
ptm6840 code. [Atari Ace]

Fixed offset for sprite and layers in fcrash driver. [Robiza]

SH4 CPU core improvements: [Samuele Zannoli]
 - corrected opcode decoding and decodes all opcodes of sh4
 - corrected disassembly and added support for all instruction of 
    sh4 not in sh2
 - now disassembles all fpu instructions
 - changed cpu to little-endian (sh4 can be either big or little)
 - corrected which data is read and written from memory 
 - added registers fpul and dbr
 - added (non-fpu) instructions of sh4 non present in sh2
 - added four fpu instructions
 - modified memory-mapped internal register management so that all 
    internal registers can be actually used
 - added file sh4regs.h with defines for all sh7750 internal registers
 - implemented internal registers for memory refresh
 - removed some internal registers of sh2 not present in sh4
 - added preliminary support for internal cache used as ram

Updated CPS2 decryption bit order to match what is likely the original
order. [Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed a few warnings that show up with -Wextra.
[Atari Ace, Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed toaplan2.c so that OKI6295 sample ROM bankswitching via one
of the spare data lines on the coin mechanism port is only hooked up 
in the one game that's actually wired this way (shippumd). [AWJ]

Updated the scrambls protection implementation to use equations based
on the implementation from fpgaarcade.com. [Mark McDougall]

Improved GCD computations in the rendlay.c code. [Christophe Jaillet]

Fixed numerous regressions in the 0.116 release.
[Zsolt Vasvari, Aaron Giles]

Switched driver code to exclusively using mame_rand() instead of
rand(), to improve consistency of results. [Aaron Giles]

Improved MCU timing and communication in the qix driver. Still a few
issues remain. [Aaron Giles]
