0.35 BETA 9

After the problems with the last few betas, this should be a stable release
again. All games which worked before the core changes should be working again.
Let us know if you find some still broken.


New games supported:
--------------------

Sindbad Mystery [Nicola Salmoria, Mike Balfour]
Yamato (preliminary) [Nicola Salmoria]
Super Burger Time [Bryan McPhail]
Gaplus [Manuel Abadia, Ernesto Corvi]
Van Van Car [Allard van der Bas]
Super Locomotive [Zsolt Vasvari]


New clones supported:
---------------------

Crazy Climber (bootleg set 2) [Zsolt Vasvari]
Pac Man (modified) [Allard van der Bas]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed background in Pig Newton. [Mike Balfour]

- Fixed the Galaxian-style starfield. Believe it or not, it had been broken
  since day 1. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Converted the System 16 drivers to use the TileMap system - they are now
  cleaner, faster, and support screen rotation. [Phil Stroffolino]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed hangs in Super Real Darwin when big bosses come, however the order
  they appear in is likely wrong (it's a protection issue). If you know the
  correct order, contact mish@tendril.force9.net. [Bryan McPhail]

- Emulated the protection in Jump Bug (Rock-ola). Some ROM splitup too, and
  fixed colors. [Zsolt Vasvari]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] New tweaked 256x256 VGA modes (both scanlines and noscanlines)
  stretched to fill the screen. They are automatically used for horizontal
  games, and are preferable to the -stretch option since they are faster.
  You might have to adjust your monitor settings to make them properly
  centered and fill the screen (use the border displayed on startup as a
  guideline). [Valerio Verrando]


Source:
-------

- The debugger is almost complete. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Redesigned the struct InputPort to use less space, and changed how analog
  inputs are defined. An additional benefit is that the keys for digital
  emulation of analog inputs are now defined in the Keys for this Game menu,
  together with all other keys, instead that in the Analog Controls menu.
  The Analog Controls menu remains to set the other parameters.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added default strings for dip switches. For example, instead of "Cabinet",
  use DEF_STR( Cabinet ). The constants are defined in inptport.h.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


==========================================================================


0.35 BETA 8

Most of the problems of beta 7 have been fixed, but the C 68000 core still
isn't 100%.

Tower of Druaga (set 2) [Yasuhiro Ogawa]
Warp Warp (Namco) [Yasuhiro Ogawa]
King and Balloon (Japan) [Yasuhiro Ogawa]
Aero Fighters (Turbo Force hardware) [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed missing item at the bottom of the screen in Tower of Druaga.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed again the colors in Lode Runner 2. This time it should really be 100%.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Implemented the RC filters in early Konami games (Time Pilot, Pooyan, etc.)
  [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Added voices to Rolling Thunder. [Ernesto Corvi]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed 1 player start button not working on level 31 of Tower of Druaga.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Added a "Game History" entry to the menu. Data is fetched from the file
  HISTORY.DAT. Thanks to Brian Deuel, Neil Bradley and the Retrocade dev team
  for allowing us to use Retrocade's game history database. [John Butler]

- All new, completely rewritten debugger (not finished yet). [Juergen
  Buchmueller]

- [DOS] Switches -noartwork and -nosamples to turn off artwork or sample
  loading. [Valerio Verrando]


==========================================================================


0.35 BETA 7

New games supported:
--------------------

The Battle-Road [Eric Hustvedt]


New clones supported:
---------------------

Block Block (bootleg) [Nicola Salmoria]
TNZS (bootleg) [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Added the missing background layer to Cobra Command. [Bryan McPhail]

- Colors & sprites in Super Real Darwin should be correct. [Bryan McPhail]

- Char/sprite priority in Lode Runner 2 & 3 and in Battle Road. [Eric Hustvedt]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed the in game timer in Captain Silver, this probably fixes other
  gameplay glitches. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed controls in Gondomania and Last Mission. [Bryan McPhail]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- new switch "-waitvsync /-nowaitvsync" (use it with -novsync); it waits for
  video sync before drawing the screen but uses the normal MAME throttling.
  This gives smoother display with scrolling game (like vsync), but works
  with video modes with higher refresh frequency, and is more win-friendly.
  [Valerio Verrando]


Source:
-------

- Major overhaul to the cpu cores. Note that the debugger doesn't work in this
  release. [Juergen Buchmueller]


==========================================================================


0.35 BETA 6

Note: the CPU cores have been completely torn apart and rearranged in this
release. Don't be surprised if a large number of games donì't work at all.
FOr example, Twin Cobra doesn't boot, and most (all?) of the games using
a 6803 lock up (ctrl-alt-del needed).


New games supported:
--------------------

Space Wars [Aaron Giles, Zonn Moore, Jeff Mitchell, Neil Bradley]
Vectorbeam [Aaron Giles, Zonn Moore, Jeff Mitchell, Neil Bradley]
Star Hawk [Aaron Giles, Zonn Moore, Jeff Mitchell, Neil Bradley]

New clones supported:
---------------------

Pocket Gal 2 [Bryan McPhail]
Super Pool III [Bryan McPhail]
Scramble (Konami) [Zsolt Vasvari]
Scramble (bootleg) [Zsolt Vasvari]
Yie-Ar Kung Fu (set 1) [Zsolt Vasvari]
Tazz-Mania (Strategy X hardware) [Zsolt Vasvari]
Eliminator (2 Players, set 2) [Thierry Lescot]
Super Buster Bros (KEEP 1 PRESSED WHILE BOOTING THE FIRST TIME)
Ninja Princes (not encrypted) [Nicola Salmoria]
Rolling Thunder (set 2) [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed colors in Lode Runner 2. Also fixed the layout of round 8 and 28.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] New -stretch option to optionally stretch low resolution games to fill
  the screen. The default is -stretch off, which is the same behaviour as
  before. -stretch 1024x768 automatically uses the "quadra" mode for horizontal
  games whose resolution is less or equal to 256x256. -stretch 800x600 uses
  the "triple" mode. The -quadra and -triple options are no longer needed and
  have been removed.
  1024x768 will be perfect (for 256x256 games) or almost perfect (for 256x240
  and 256x224 games) without monitor adjustment, so it is indicated for LCD
  displays. However, it is slower than 800x600. 800x600 is faster but the games
  are stretched to resolutions from 768x448 to 768x512, so they don't fill the
  screen and are squashed vertically. Here's the tip: if your monitor is good
  enough, you can use the controls to expand the picture and make it fit
  perfectly in the screen. Note that this tip  applies not only to stretched
  modes, but also to med-res games like Lode Runner (384x256) and the CPS1
  games (384x224). The CPS1 games in particular are unbearably squashed unless
  you adjust the monitor. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New option -volume n to set the startup volume. The volume is an
  attenuation in dB, e. g. "-volume -12" will start with a -12dB attenuation.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- The user interface is rotated by -rol and -ror. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improvements to the YM2610 timers, added an interface for external volume
  control. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Major changes to the whole CPU interface and cores. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- [DOS] All new, completely rewritten autoframeskip code. [Nicola Salmoria]


==========================================================================


0.35 BETA 5

New games supported:
--------------------

Boulder Dash [Bryan McPhail]
Crackshot [Aaron Giles]
Vimana [Darren Olafson]


New clones supported:
---------------------

Crush Roller (set 2) [Zsolt Vasvari]
Rampage (revision 2) [Zsolt Vasvari]
Satan's Hollow (set 2, only the sound ROMs are different) [Zsolt Vasvari]
Bosconian (Midway set 2) [Zsolt Vasvari]
Galaxians (bootleg) [Zsolt Vasvari]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Kludged in a fix for char/sprite priority in Traverse USA. [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Sound in Pac-Land, and improved Rolling Thunder. [Ernesto Corvi]

- Full sound in Sly Spy, Midnight Resistance, Dark Seal. [Bryan McPhail]

- Emulated the death sound in Mario Bros, the sample is no longer used.
  [Brian Stern]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- DEC8 games. [Roberto Fresca]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Emulated the protection in Sly Spy. [Bryan McPhail]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Added a header to .inp files (same as MAME32). With the additional
  header, the user no longer needs to specify the game name when playing back
  .inp recordings. [Mike Haaland]

- Added the ability to show the total number of colors on screen. This is
  useful during development to know if a game can be shrinked to 256 colors or
  it requires a 16-bit display. Press CTRL+F11 to toggle the display. This is
  only available in debug builds. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- The TileMap code is now mature enough to be used in new drivers. For
  examples, look into gng, gaiden, travrusa. [Phil Stroffolino]

- Merged the old and new Namco sound subssytem, and added support for stereo
  output. [Aaron Giles]

- H6280 emulator, used by several DECO games. [Bryan McPhail]


==========================================================================


0.35 BETA 4

New games supported:
--------------------

Block Block
Super Pang (KEEP 1 PRESSED WHILE BOOTING THE FIRST TIME)
Digger [Raney Eden]

New clones supported:
---------------------

Pang (original)
Buster Bros
Smash TV (revision 6 and 4) [Zsolt Vasvari]
alternate versions of MK and MK2 (they were already there, just not linked)


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- It seems that the Fatal Fury 2 protection was still causing some problems in
  later levels. It should now be completely worked around. NOTE: YOU MUST
  DELETE FATFURY2.HI OR THE GAME WILL MALFUNCTION AFTER THE FIRST BONUS ROUND.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] New -quadra and -triple video options. They are slower than the
  others, but provide interesting features. With -quadra the screen is
  quadrupled horizontally and tripled vertically, so a 256x256 game fits
  perfectly in a 1024x768 screen. -triple triples horizontally and doubles
  vertically, so it's perfect for Moon Patrol. [ole00@usa.net]

- Improved palette compression with color fades. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved the YM2610 emulation. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Now compiled using Allegro 3.11. Unfortunately, contrary to what I
  had been promised, allegro.h provided with the library still fails to
  compile with MAME, so a fixed one is included.

  pirate board. Wizards *do* throw stones in this version. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed the protection in Fatal Fury 2. [Eugenio De Renzi]

- Emulated the protection (TMS32010) in Twin Cobra, which is now fully
  playable. [Quench]

- Fixed the protection in Frisky Tom. [Andrew Prime]

- Properly emulated the 68705 protection in The Electric Yo-Yo, Kram, Space

  [Phil Stroffolino]

- [DOS] X86 asm Z80 core. [Juergen Buchmueller]


==========================================================================


Note: the CPU cores are still in a state of flux. Most of the problems in 35b1
have been fixed, however some still remain (e.g. Gauntlet doesn't accept
coins and Exterminator crashes).

  Dragon Ninja and Sly Spy. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed the title screen in P.O.W. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed gaps in the start/finish line in Neo Drift Out. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Attempt at emulating some raster effects in the NeoGeo games. The IRQ2
  handling is still 99% unknown, however you can see the field in Super
  Sidekicks 3 and 4. This is largely unaccurate, and VERY slow. Hit F1 to
  toggle the emulation on or off (by default it's on). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Almost accurate colors in Galivan. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved row scrolling in Street Fighter 2, plus several other fixes to the
  CPS1 games. [Paul Leaman]

- Fixed sprite colors in Euro League. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Good progress in sound emulation of the Exidy games (Venture, Pepper 2, etc.)
  [Dan Boris]

- Fixed the YM2203 in Ghost Busters. [Bryan McPhail]

- Speech in TMNT. Sound should now be 100% complete. [Howie Cohen]

- Emulated speech in Sinistar. Samples are no longer used. [Alex Pasadyn]

- Sound in The Main Event. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Sound fade timer ports in the CPS1 games (see Willow's Test mode for an
  example). [Paul Leaman]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Side Pocket, Rolling Thunder. [Dave W.]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Emulated the protection in Seicross, Radical Radial, Frisky Tom. However
  Frisky Tom is still not playable (hangs when you fall). [Nicola Salmoria]

- The hang in Tapper should REALLY be fixed this time. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Emulated the protection in Knights of the Round and Carrier Air Wing.
  [Paul Leaman]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] The key to change frameskip is now F9 instead of F8. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- New 68000 C core. For testing purposes, this is also being used in the DOS
  version instead of the asm core. [Karl Stenerud]
  Differences:

  1. Faster.  This code is, barring ram fetch time, almost twice as fast as the
     existing C core in MAME.  I've done extensive speed profiling on both
     engines.  The only problem now is the slow memory access in MAME due to
     bankswitching et al.

  2. Emulation more correct.  I found many bugs in the MAME engine (and many,
     many more in mine for that matter) when I pitted them head-to-head.
     I have run random instructions from each opcode class at least 10 million
     times, comparing the resultant CPU states, and have left it running random
     instructions for 1 billion iterations.  In every case, I have adhered to
     the specs defined in M68000PM/AD REV. 1.

  3. Disassembler is correct.  The current M68000 disassembler in mame has a
     tendency to disassemble instructions that have an invalid EA mode.

  4. Cycle counting is 99.9% correct.  The only instructions which don't have
     correct cycle counts are divs, divu, muls, mulu, and they're not worth
     counting correctly. (I'm not about to waste emulation time counting 0-1 and
     1-0 sequences).

  5. > 32 bit friendly.  I've taken care to ensure maximum portability without
     sacrificing speed.  The result is conditional compiling dependant on your
     architecture.  I've also implemented and tested a compatible solution for
     architectures that lack 8, 16, or 32 bit signed storage types.

  6. The code is carefully laid out to be readable. (I beg to differ - NS)

- Fixed some bugs in the I8039 emulation. [Brian Stern]

- Z8000 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- NEC uPD7759 emulation. This is used by TMNT, System 16, and others.
  [Juergen Buchmueller, Mike Balfour, Howie Cohen]

- CVSD emulation, used for speech in Sinistar and in the 34010 games (Smash TV
  etc.). [Larry Bank, Alex Pasadyn]


==========================================================================


0.35 BETA 1

Note: the configuration save format has changed. You may just as well delete
all of the cfg/*.cfg files, since they won't be loaded. Old .inp files will not
work either.
The good news is that the default key assignments can now be modified, so you
don't have to change them for all the games. The code is a quick hack put
together in fifteen minutes, but it's bettern than nothing. It will be improved
in future versions.


New games supported:

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed Psychic 5 and Toki title screens. [Jarek Parchanski]

- Proper support of the playfiled/sprite priority and palette system in Return
  of the Jedi. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Accurate colors in Spelunker II. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed Heiankyo Alien colors. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed NeoGeo palette - it's 5 bits per gun, not 4. Of course this makes the
  reduction to 256 colors even more difficult. 16-bit video modes will be
  supported in a later version. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added a kludge to avoid leftover sprites in Rally-X. [Larry Bank]

- Fixed missing background behind the three towers in Metal Slug level 1.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed missing line in the tank's shot in Metal Slug intro. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed the Swimmer side panel background color. [Gary Walton]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Fixed shoot sound in Juno First. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added PCM samples to Ninja Kid II. [Jarek Parchanski]

- Added the 007232 to TMNT. Another sound chip is still missing to get 100%
  sound. [Howie Cohen]

- Sound in Psycho-Nics Oscar. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Partial sound in The Real Ghostbusters. The YM203 doesn't seem to work
  correctly. [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Road Fighter, Iron Horse. [Howie Cohen]

- Lizard Wizard. [M.C. Silvius]

- Space Tactics. [Zsolt Vasvari]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Analog joystick support in Sinistar and Blaster. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Worked out the Super Punch Out protection. [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Ernesto Corvi]

- Hacked the protection in Super Sidekicks. [Battlepriest]

- Fixed two players games in Phoenix, and the protection in Pleiads (which
  made game resets not work). [Zsolt Vasvari]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Support for the Namco System 1 sound system. [Ernesto Corvi]

- [DOS] Widened the frameskip range. It now is 0-11, meaning the number of
  frames to skip out of 12. For example, if the game normally runs at 60 fps,
  "-frameskip 2" will make it run at 50 fps, and "-frameskip 6" at 30 fps.
  Also, if a frame takes more than the allotted time to display, the lost
  time can be recovered in the following frames. Moreover, improved the way
  audio streams are handled, so they stay more in sync with the video. There
  should never be any more audio breakups EVER (as long as your system can
  keep the game running at 100% speed).
  All of these changes together mean that it is now possible to run at much
  higher frame rates than before (if your system is fast enough).

- [DOS] Implemented auto frameskip. It dynamically adjusts the frameskip
  setting to display the maximum possible frames without dropping below 100%
  speed.
  It is on by default; to turn it off, specify an explicit frameskip value,
  e.g. "-frameskip 0". Autoframeskip only works well if your machine is fast
  enough to run the game at 100% speed. If it isn't, you had better use a
  fixed frameskip.
  NOTE: you must delete mame.cfg (or manually change the line "frameskip = 0"
  to "frameskip = auto") for the auto frameskip to become the default.

- [DOS] "vmame" modes 320x480 and 400x600, which speed up scanlined VESA modes
  for some games and graphic cards which support these resolutions.
  Currently, these modes will not be autodetected, that is, the commandline
  options "-320x480" or "-400x600" have to be used.
  [Nicola Salmoria, Michael Cunnanan]

- [DOS] Joysticks are now selected by a symbolic name (e.g. "-joystick wingex"
  for Wingman Extreme) instead of a number. For the list of names, look into
  readme.txt. Numbers are still supported, but may not be in future releases.
  SNES gamepads on parallel ports are supported now, provided you have some
  additional hardware (the "official" Snespad-Support site is
  http://snespad.emulationworld.com). [Bernd Wiebelt]

- [DOS] For cosmetical reasons, added support for VESA3, which can be selected
  by putting "vesamode=vesa3" into mame.cfg. It is highly unlikely that you'll
  get any speed improvement. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- New function cpu_getcurrentframe() which returns the number of the video
  frame currently being played. It can be used by drivers to control effects
  which spawn over multiple frames (e.g. blinking) without using static
  internal counter (which would require a custom interrupt handler to avoid
  problems when the game is paused). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Frame skipping is entirely handled by the OS dependant code.
  osd_skip_this_frame() no longer has the "recommend" parameter.
  Also, replaced osd_update_display() and osd_update_audio() with the single
  osd_update_video_and_audio().
  IMPORTANT: osd_update_video_and_audio() is called *every frame* by the main
  core. It's its responsability to know whether the frame has to be skipped.
  osd_skip_this_frame() is used by the main core only to know if it can avoid
  calling drv->vh_update(). [Nicola Salmoria]

- New Z80 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed several bugs in the I86 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- New CPU interrupt system. The functions cpu_set_irq_line() and
  cpu_set_nmi_line() can be used to precisely control the status of the CPU
  physical lines, instead of using the limited control granted by
  cpu_cause_interrupt(). [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Konami 007232 sound chip emulator. This is used by TMNT. [Hiromitsu Shioya]

- The driver input ports are now 16 bit. This allows for higher resolution
  analog inputs (Arkanoid 2). Also, the 68000 based games no longer have to
  read and mix two 8 bit ports to get a 16 bit value. [Brad Oliver]

- [DOS] Now compiled with Allegro 3.1. Unfortunately the standard allegro.h
  doesn't compile with the pedantic compiler setup we are using, you'll have to
  use the provided fixed version instead. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- Added a horrible dirty hack to allow opcode encryption on CPUs other than
  the main one. It's really ugly and needs a rewrite, but it's enough to get
  sound in Pocket Gal and The Real Ghostbusters. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Exported info_cpu_name(), info_sound_name() and other similar functions from
  info.c so they can be used by usrintf.c and by anyone else who needs them.
