IMPORTANT NOTE FOR OSD PORTERS: This build requires a pair of new
primitives in the OSD synchronization module, as well as some extended
functionality in the work item management. See below for details.



MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
cabal0119u2ora [David Haywood]



Source Changes
--------------
Fixed Cabal (joystick) submission from previous release. 
[David Haywood]

Made a few improvements to dealem (well you can see the game now..)
[David Haywood]

Fixed broken SCSP from last update. [R. Belmont]

Changed parameters to read/write handlers from "address" to an 
unmodified "original_address" parameter (having the passed parameter 
being unmodified makes it easier to determine the original value while
debugging). [Nathan Woods]

Fixed colors in dynduke. [David Haywood]

Changed the following x86 instructions to read/write an entire word 
rather than two separate bytes: [Philip Bennett]
 - mov_axdisp
 - mov_dispax
 - stosw (8086 only)
 - rep stosw (8086 only)
Also tweaked handling of x86 WAIT instruction.

Several more opcode fixes for Risky Challenge. [robiza]

Cleaned up the include file usage in the code: [Atari Ace]
 - Removed dead prototypes
 - Added missing self-#includes
 - Added missing source comments in mame/includes
 - Migrated the few #include "driver.h" lines from driver header
    files to source files (which is the common idiom).
 - Eliminated #include "mame.h", "osdcore.h" et cetera from driver
    files where #include "driver.h" would suffice.
 - Removed unused srmp6.h and 9900stat.h

Added the rom loading for the various 5*XX roms, which are dumped but
not yet hooked up. [David Haywood]

Fixed error messages output from option.c. [Christophe Jaillet]

gstream driver update: [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
 - Changed to use a default nvram handler
 - Checked the inputs
 - Aligned the sprites
 - Added some comments about oki banking
 
Major Sega Model 2 rewrite: [Ernesto Corvi]
 - Decoupled the geometry engine code from the hardware rasterizer.
    At this point, we could add emulation of the geometry DSPs for 
    the 2B and 2C models, and hook them directly to the rasterizer. 
    For the original and 2A models, an HLE geometry engine is provided 
    (currently in use for all models).
 - Full Geometry Engine simulation, including support for specular, 
    multiple centers and dual polygon RAM.
 - Support for all textured/transparent/checkered rendering modes.
 - Improved texel/luma modulation
 - Improved viewport clipping
 - Improved z clipping
 - Extensive notes and documentation.
 - Greatly improved near Z-Clipping, still not perfect though.
 - Improved perspective-correct texturing for large textures.
 - Improved Z-Sorting
 
Changed Machine to machine in several places where feasible.
[Atari Ace]

Added decryption of Jongkyo. [Nicola Salmoria]

The OSD layer is now required to supply to additional synchronization
primitives: osd_compare_exchange32() and osd_compare_exchange64().
These primitives should implement an atomic compare and exchange of
32-bit and 64-bit values, respectively. Added implementations of these
functions to the Windows OSD layer. [Aaron Giles]

Defined two new inline functions that are built on the new OSD
primitives: osd_compare_exchange_ptr(), which performs an atomic 
compare/exchange on a pointer of the appropriate size, and
osd_sync_add() which atomically adds a value to a location in memory.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed implementation of OSD work queues that are created with the
WORK_QUEUE_FLAG_MULTI hint. Such queues now create n-1 threads, where
n in the number of logical processors in the system. This allows the
main thread to continue accomplishing things while other threads 
process the work. If the main thread subsequently calls
osd_work_queue_wait(), it will then dynamically "jump in" and help
the other threads complete all the work items. [Aaron Giles]

Added new work item flag WORK_ITEM_FLAG_SHARED. When specified on a
work item that is queued to a work queue created with the
WORK_QUEUE_FLAG_MULTI hint, it means that all threads will be 
dispatched to process the one work item, instead of the first thread
removing it. These "shared" work items are only considered complete
when all processing threads have returned. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for controlling multithreading behavior through an
environment variable OSDPROCESSORS. To override the default behavior,
set OSDPROCESSORS equal to the number of logical processors you wish
the OSD layer to pretend you have. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the 3dfx Voodoo emulation code to take advantage of the new
threading mechanisms above. It now creates a work queue with the
WORK_QUEUE_FLAG_MULTI flag set, and uses shared work items to spread
rasterization work across multiple processors. Note that this support
should be considered experimental; under some circumstances it is
known to deadlock. If you encounter problems, set OSDPROCESSORS to 1
to effectively produce the previous behavior. [Aaron Giles]

Added "top 20" dedicated rasterizers for all the Seattle games and
Gauntlet Legends/Dark Legacy. These improve rasterization performance
by another 10-20%. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed several more bugs in the 64-bit MIPS recompiler. It is now
capable of running the Seattle games and the 3D Gauntlets. 
[Aaron Giles]

MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
model2c_crx0119u1red [R. Belmont]



Source Changes
--------------
Changed gfx_decode structures so that they are defined abstractly
by macros rather than directly specifying the structures. Added
new macros GFXDECODE_START/GFXDECODE_ENTRY/GFXDECODE_END to
describe the gfx_decode information. Converted all drivers over to
using the new macros. [Atari Ace]

Fixed NMI handling in h6280 CPU core. [Wilbert Pol]

Fixed vaportra to use an ASSERT/CLEAR mechanism instead of PULSE_LINE
for interrupt signally. [Wilbert Pol]

Cleaned up input ports in sg1000a.c. Added DIP switch for the coins 
in dokidoki and service switch. Added DIP switch for flip screen in
psychic5. [sonikos]

Cleans up the input port for macrossp.c driver and adds dip 
locations. [Brian Troha]

Adds dip locations and changes the Japanese inputs into 
PORT_INCLUDE and PORT_MODIFY. [Brian Troha]

Added macros to clean up definitions of the discrete sound 
interfaces. At the same time, made them all const. [Atari Ace]

Some miscellaneous changes to the megatech driver. [David Haywood]

More srmp6 improvements. [686]

Two small Model 2 fixes: [Ernesto Corvi]
 - fixed triangle parser; all objects should be structurally 
    correct now
 - fixed normal transform to not use the translation vectors

Cleaned up code to make code and data static where possible and
remove some dead code. [Atari Ace]

SCSP improvements: [R. Belmont, ElSemi]
 - fixed issue with changing the pitch of an active voice set to 
    backwards or bidirectional loop
 - removed fake reverb
 - fixed internal DSP to operate properly 
 - rewrote timers and interrupt handling
 - fixed operation when 2 SCSPs are present

Fixed sound in almost all SCSP-equipped Model 2 games. [R. Belmont]

Added sound hardware and fixed sound ROM loading in Model 3 games.
[R. Belmont]

Created an options_output_diff_ini_file() API, which is similar to 
options_output_ini_file(), but only outputs the options which are 
different than a base core_options. Changed INI outputting (and 
hence the -cc option) to omit headers that do not contain any 
options. [Nathan Woods]

Hooked up sound in discoboy. [Tomasz Slanina]

Renamed old gfx_decode structure to gfx_decode_entry in order to
catch remaining/new drivers that aren't using the new macros.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed profiler so that it is independently selected versus the
debug build. Built with MAME_PROFILER=1 to enable the profiler on
a non-debug build. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed MIPS3 disassembly of j/jal instructions. [Aaron Giles]

Switched MIPS3 64-bit DRC over to new system that is more aggressive
about register allocation and mapping. Sadly, there is little to no
obvious performance benefit, but the resulting code is better
organized. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed nasty x86emit bug involving 16-bit opcodes on 64-bit systems.
[Aaron Giles]

Created new generic x86/x64 logging system x86log, and updated both
MIPS3 DRC cores to use it. [Aaron Giles]

Created new generic DRC frontend management. Future work involves
retooling the MIPS3 frontend around this new architecture.

along the way. [Ernesto Corvi]

Fixed synchronization code in the Model 2 driver. [Ernesto Corvi]

Fixed SCALER, SCALERL, and ATANRL opcodes in the i960 core. 
[Ernesto Corvi]

Updates to the gdrawpkr driver: [Roberto Fresca]

board in Pop'n Music 7 to the Firebeat driver. [Ville Linde]

Cleaned up input ports in the taito_z.c driver. [Brian Troha]

Updated the sources to support removing -wno-unused-function. Dead 
code has been identified with #ifdef UNUSED_FUNCTION to allow for
further analysis and potential future removal. [Atari Ace]

Fixed a number of issues in the h6280 CPU core: [Wilbert Pol]
 - Taking of interrupts is delayed to respect a pending instruction 
    already in the instruction pipeline.
 - Added 1 cycle for decimal mode ADC and SBC instructions.
 - Changed cycle counts for CSH and CSL instructions to 3.
 - Added T flag support to the SBC instruction.
 - Fixed ADC T flag to set the Z flag based on the value read.
 - Added 3 cycle penalty to ADC, AND, EOR, ORA, and SBC instructions
    when the T flag is set.
 - Fixed cycle count and support for 65536 byte blocks for the TAI, 
    TDD, TIA, TII, and TIN instructions.

Moved srmp5 (Super Real Mahjong P5) to separate driver (from 
st0016.c). Preliminary video hw emulation. Not playable, no sound.
[Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed DIP switches in the mario driver. [stephh]

Major Namco System 21 update. Changes include: [Phil Stroffolino]
 - corrections to eprom handling (affects Namco System2 as well)
 - scroll fix for sprite emulation in namcoic.c
 - working Starblade, Cybersled, Solvalou with full 3d
 - graphics should be 100% except for the depth cueing tables, which 
    are internal and need to be reconstructed
 - Air Combat is improved, but is locking up in 118s because of 
    incomplete watchdog emulation
 - Winning Run hardware is not yet working in this update

Fixed regression in undoukai caused by the REGION_CPU1 decoupling
from RAM. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

SCSP fixes: [R. Belmont]
 * Fix writes to the hole in the SCSP address space (0x430 to 0x5ff) 
    to not trash global registers
 * Fixed SCSP DMA to not read random memory for its' registers

Added minimal built-in layout for showing the lamps in Video Pinball. 
[Mr. Do!]

Big Model 2 update. There's so much stuff improved, I'm just going to 
list what's not working: [Ernesto Corvi, El Semi]
 - There's still a glitch on the triangle parser somewhere. 
    Noticeable on the Sega logo in motoraid, the selection arrow in 
    dynamcop's player select screen and many other games. It might be 
    the culprit of the road in daytona looking wacky.
 - There's a problem with the z clipping. Some tri's close to the 
    camera are clipped before they should. Some others should be 
    clipped but are not, and are blocking the viewport for a frame 
    or two.
 - Sub-windows are not implemented yet. Visible on dynacop's mission 
    select, Sega Rally car select, and others.
 - Most decal textures flicker on and off between frames. Maybe a z 
    coordinate float resolution issue after projection?
 - Textures wrap by default. They should only wrap when the 
    appropriate flag is set only. Not sure what to do when we're not 
    wrapping.

Improvements to the Z180 core: [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
 - added the 2 Programmable Reload Timers
 - fixed the Internal I/O Registers remapping
 - added logical -> physical memory translation
 - disabled loops hack
 - removed "extra icount"
 - changed interrupts handling. Now they're checked as in Z80 core
 - simplified RETN and EI opcodes
 - fixed PRT interrupts
 - cleared both interrupts flip flops when taking any irq
 - added _IFF2 = _IFF1; just before _IFF1 = 0; when taking an NMI

Removed kludge in 20pacgal which is no longer necessary with proper
Z180 emulation. Sound now works as well. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed some Dip Switches and added some extra notes to othunder.c 
driver. Also added some notes to opwolf.c driver. [stephh]

Began moving the MegaTech/MegaPlay drivers over to the new Genesis
core code. [David Haywood]

Identified a number of additional new opcodes for Risky Challenge/
Gussun. [robiza]

Fixed Voodoo video timing according to the manual, including blanking
periods and vsync interrupts. This makes Carnevil and some other games
run once again at their proper speed. [Aaron Giles]

Updated Voodoo drawing code to track changes to the front buffer and
allow skipping unrendered frames for more even framerates. 
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed hang when attempting to move windows with the debugger active
and multithreading enabled. [Aaron Giles]

Added preliminary attempt at a new x64 dynamic recompiler for the
MIPS 3/4 CPUs. The current version works enough to run a few basic
games (kinst, carnevil), but many others fail. Furthermore, this
version is already being supplanted by a more advanced version that
does register allocation and constant folding. For now it is disabled
by default. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed a few more 64-bit disassembler problems in i386dasm.c. Also
fixed several 64-bit errors in the code generators in x86emit.h. 
[Aaron Giles]

Added support in the debugger memory view for 8-byte chunk sizes.
Fixed long-standing bug that failed to show unmapped logical addresses
as asterisks. Also added new menu items to the Windows debugger to 
support viewing logical or physical memory. [Aaron Giles]

Removed limitation that tilemap tile widths must be divisible by
2, except in the 4bpp case, where an assert now catches this case.
[Aaron Giles]

Experimentally changed full screen behavior when using Direct3D so
that if -switchres is NOT enabled, then we don't create a fullscreen
Direct3D device. This minimizes large graphics card transitions (in
particular it does not disable glass in Vista) when you go full 
screen. If you want the old behavior, run with -switchres and specify
a -resolution parameter equal to your desktop screen size.
