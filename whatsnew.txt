Source Changes
--------------
Updated dacholer.c driver with now all known Dip Switches. [stephh]

Changed MDRV_VBLANK_DURATION macro to accept subseconds directly
instead of converting from double. Added new macro USEC_TO_SUBSECONDS
to assist in this. Converted all drivers over to using it. 
[Atari Ace]

Improved/fixed validation of memory maps to match current logic in
memory.c. Fixed a few problems that were identified this way.
Also removed construct_map_0 and isolated map construction to a 
single function. [Atari Ace]

Added new AM_READ_PORT() macro which lets you define an input port
read callback based on a port tag. This is now preferred over the
previous technique of calling port_tag_to_handler() within an
AM_READ() macro. Updated all drivers that were using the latter
pattern to the new system. [Atari Ace]

Fixed subtle monymony regression from 0.36b10(!) [Atari Ace]

Fixed F8 CPU core to not clobbert the irq_callback on a reset.
[Wilbert Pol]

Amiga system updates: [Ernesto Corvi]
 - Implemented the ECS-only BLTSIZV and BLTSIZH custom registers, 
    and modified BLTSIZE and the blitter to use them.
 - Properly implemented the bit in VPOSR that indicates if we're 
    running on a PAL or NTSC Amiga.
 - Fixed the PAL clock on the Pictomatic driver in alg.c

Added counter emulation to the COP420 CPU core. Hooked it up to
Thayer's Quest and added an alternate set. [Andrew Gardner]

Added missing PROMs to the Status Trivia driver. [Brian Troha]

Cleaned up several Taito drivers (opwolf.c, othunder.c, topspeed.c,
warriorb.c, wgp.c, rastan.c, rainbow.c, volfied.c) to use common 
input port macros. Fixed the Dip Switches for all games (a few still 
remain unknown though) and added many notes. Also fixed a couple of 
things which were wrong in ninjaw.c driver. Improved the C-chip 
emulation for "Operation Wolf" and its clones so it can now handle 
multiple coinage settings. [stephh]

Improved the MCU simulation for aladbl so now the game handles coins 
correctly. Fixed the Inputs to match an arcade cabinet and added 
Dip Switches according to the game M68000 code. [stephh]

Added build tool to extract version information and add it to the
Windows version resource. [Nathan Woods]

Added a fairly complete WD33C93 SCSI controller emulation, and also 
updated the cps3.c driver to use it. [Ernesto Corvi]

Hooked up lamps in Chase HQ. [R. Belmont, couriersud]

Changed NEC V30 CPU core to use a 16-bit data bus. Updated affected
drivers: raiden, raiden2, m72, m90, m92, m107, segas32, hng64,
deadang, dynduke, sengokmj, shanghai, lockon, tatsumi, fantland,
twins, gunpey, ttchamp. Separated V-series disassembler from the
i386 disassembler and updated it to use proper register and
opcode terminology. [Aaron Giles, Philip Bennett, Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Changed I8086 CPU core to use a 16-bit data bus. Updated affected
drivers: gottlieb, leland, tx1, fantland, tetriunk. Cleaned up 
naming of CPUs (i86 -> i8086, etc.) [Aaron Giles]

Added 16-bit handlers to a number of the shared PC components. 
[Nathan Woods]

Consolidated common code between drc and non-drc MIPS cores.
[Aaron Giles]

NOTE: If you are experiencing sound stuttering due to not being able
to run your display at >60Hz, please give the -speed option a try.
You should be able to run MAME at a small emulation speed decrease
in order to get the game under your monitor's refresh rate.

Source Changes
--------------
Fixed recently introduced regression in nemesis driver. [Atari Ace]

Improved fixes to the chdman CD creating code. [smf]

Updated amspdwy.c driver to fix the DIP Switches for 'amspdwy' which 
are slightly different than the ones for 'amspdwya' which were 
correct. [stephh]

Fixed HP Saturn CPU core disassembler. [Wilbert Pol]

Fixed clock speed and colors in Trivia Genius. [Lord Nightmare]

Cleaned up Taito drivers to use common defines for common input 
ports across drivers. [stephh]

Removed redundant hard-coded definitions for Pole Position pedals.
[Alex Jackson]

Improved DIP switches for bombjack. [stephh]

Changed default layouts in BFM games to hide VFD by default since it
is not visible. [James Wallace]

Further improvements to the TMS5220 emulation and more unification
with the TMS5110 core. [Lord Nightmare]

Changed INI parsing to look for source file INIs in <inipath>/source
first. This is to disambiguate INIs where the game name matches the
source filename. If the INI file is not found in <inipath>/source,
then it is looked for in the <inipath> as before. [Aaron Giles]

Merged Raiden memory maps. Cleaned up the COP emulation code in 
Raiden 2. [Aaron Giles]

Added new experimental control for overall emulation speed. This
lets you specify how fast/slow the gameplay should happen relative to
the original. -speed 1.0 means run at normal speed. -speed 2.0 means
run at 2x speed. -speed 0.5 means run at half speed. Note that the
sound pitch is shifted as a result. If you are running early Namco
games that normally run at 60.60Hz, you can run them at -speed 0.99
and it should run at under 60Hz, which should prevent sound stuttering
if your monitor is not capable of greater than 60Hz refresh rates.
If this turns out to be useful, future versions may support a 
-speed refresh parameter that automatically tweaks the speed to keep
you under your monitor's refresh rate. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed disassembly of V30 bit instructions. [Aaron Giles]

boogwing0118yel [Aaron Giles]



Source Changes
--------------
Fixed behavior of auto_realloc() so that it always reallocs from its
original pool. [Atari Ace]

Fixed divide-by-zero when running with -video none in some cases.
[Atari Ace]

ARM7 core fixes: [R. Belmont, Ryan Holtz]
 - Fixed behavior when R15 is the source of a MOV
 - Fixed flags calc for ADC/SBC
 - Fixed flags calc for NEG
 - Fixed flags calc for CMP
 - Fixed time running backwards on Thumb instructions
 - Fixed some ARM instructions doing indiscriminate change_pc()s

Fixed converting CD's containing audio that were ripped by cdrdao, 
which was broken recently. The code is cleaner and more maintainable 
now. [smf]

Fixed chdman_open() "w" to always create/truncate the file, leaving 
"r+" to try opening first and then truncating. This matches behavior
in the core. [smf]

Added missing port 3/4 to M6803 cpu core. [Curt Coder]

Changed 6850ACIA to use MSB/LSB read handlers. [Curt Coder]

Fixed two minor bugs in the COP400 CPU disassembler. Hooked up the 
internal 64 bytes of DATA RAM to the core. [Andrew Gardner]

Added support in the debugger for reading/writing memory without
translation. [Olivier Galibert]

MSM6242 updates: [Ernesto Corvi]
 - Added support for 12/24 hour mode
 - Added support for the HOLD bit
 
Galaxian driver updates: [stephh]
 - fixed 'spcdraga' GFX ROMS loading
 - 100% verified Dip Switches for all sets
 - added long notes for all sets
 
Significantly revamped the tilemap rendering code. There are now only
two tilemap types, based on whether or not you want transparency
based on pen or color. All existing tilemap effects are built on top
of these two modes. The internal tilemap handling code has been
reorganized and simplified in a number of cases. For most games, this
change is transparent (har har), apart from the change in tilemap
type values. Several concepts within the tilemap system now have
different terminology for clarity and to remove some ambiguous naming
('priority', for example, was overloaded). A small tutorial and better
documentation is now present at the top of tilemap.h and provides
more details of the changes. [Aaron Giles]
