hornet0120u1red [Ville Linde]
srmp6_0120u1ora [Aaron Giles]



Source Changes
--------------
Rewrote ACIA6850 implementation. [Curt Coder]

Did a complete overhaul of the Mad Alien driver. [Stefan Jokish]
 - merged memory maps and added mirror addresses
 - doubled sound chip frequency
 - implemented IRQ acknowledge for the sound CPU
 - added stub functions for missing discrete sounds
 - re-implemented tilemaps (now the tunnel walls scroll into view)
 - hooked up 6845 CRT controller
 - made several fixes related to color handling
 - cleaned up inputs and added dip switch locations
 - raised main CPU speed (guesswork)
 - added save state support

Repaired the IC24 timer behaviour to fix some of Deal 'Em's bugs, 
and also added inputs. [James Wallace]

Added save state support to skykid. [Mike Haaland]

Fixed tiny.mak based on new source reorg. [Tiago Pierezan Camargo]

Added support for CR-589 firmware to the System 573 driver. Made
substantial changes to the SCSI support, making it require fewer
hacks, and allowing one device to be derived from another. Also
added save state support. [smf]

Added SCI support to M6803/HD63701. [Curt Coder]

Fixed several misnamed sound samples interfaces. [Atari Ace]

Switched model1 lookup functions to be index based rather than
requiring a linear scan. [Atari Ace]

Added generic I2C bus memory support. Hooked up to the cubocd32
driver. [smf]

Cleaned up inline assembly support: [Aaron Giles]
 * moved all inlinable functions into new module eminline.h
 * defined a number of new inline functions, including:
    - 32x32 -> 64 bit multiply
    - fast approximate floating point reciprocal
 * removed old inline definitions from osinline.h, osd_cpu.h, etc.
 * eminline.h contains C implementations of everything
 * new module eigccx86.h contains GCC-compatible x86/64 versions
 * new module eigccppc.h contains GCC-compatible PowerPC versions
 * eminline.h automatically detects GCC environments and includes
    appropriate file
 * osinline.h now only used in non-GCC environments
 * updated osd/windows/osinline.h to contain MSVC-compatible versions

Added NORM implementation to the TMS32031 core. [Aaron Giles]

Created new rgbutil module which consists of inline functions for
common RGB manipulation. This module can be accelerated with SSE2 or
other SIMD operations. By default, only 64-bit Intel builds make use
of SSE, since it can be assumed on those platforms. Reimplemented the
namcos22 rasterizer in terms of these inline functions. Also updated
the gaelco3d rasterizer to use this module for faster bilinear
filtering. [Aaron Giles]

Made some progress on the Midway Zeus-based system. The 3d command
stream is now parsed and the format is partially understood, enough to
display some polygons but with incorrect textures in Mortal Kombat 4. 
[Aaron Giles]

buckrog0118u2yel [couriersud]



Source Changes
--------------
Documented information about the various Cannonball sets.
[stephh]

Hooked up the roz layer, fg layer and sprites to f1gpb. Still
missing some video offsets, oki banking and sprites priority.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Updates for the dominob.c driver: [stephh]
 - fixed dip switches
 - fixed inputs
 - added a couple of notes

Updated peplus driver and related components: [Jim Stolis]
 - added internal layouts for the games
 - fixed several i8051 issues...
    * Fixed a bug with some opcodes having the wrong cycle counts
    * Fixed a bug where determining the proper timer mode
    * Fixed a bug where determining the proper serial transmit mode
    * Added support for split timer mode

Improved multiprocessor Voodoo performance by reducing contention
during rendering. Extended the system to allow for more overlap
between rendering and emulation. [couriersud, Aaron Giles]

Fixed a crash in the input system when you configure joypads and 
then unplug them and press Esc on the system info screen.
[R. Belmont]

Defined strict types for CPU and sound chips. Removed unnecessary
cpu_ prefix from several structure members. [Atari Ace]

Fixed the m4510 cpu core from not updating the instruction cycle
counter. [Wilbert Pol]

Fixed memory access for m6509 instructions 91 and b1. [Wilbert Pol]

Changed osdcore.h to include osinline.h and allow for external
inline definitions of synchronization primitives. Also added a new
work queue hint WORK_QUEUE_FLAG_HIGH_FREQ which indicates that we
should spin aggressively waiting for new items. 
[couriersud, Vas Crabb]

Enabled common linker warnings in the makefile. [Oliver Stoneberg]

Fixed a corner case in the SCSP involving timers which are polled 
with their IRQ enable shut off. [R. Belmont]

Namco System 21 update: [Phil Stroffolino]
 - namconb1 sprites no longer broken
 - fixed missing 3d gfx in Cybersled
 - gradient colors in starblade
 - more accurate depth cueing
 - fixed crash in 2nd stage of Starblade
 - fixed lockups in Air Combat and Solvalou
 - fixes to sprite priority (see Solvalou mountain range)
 - hooked up translucency (palette shift) effect

Changed Model 2 rendering to use pre-clipped Z values for sorting.
[Aaron Giles]

Properly identified bill inputs in Midway Y-unit driver games.
[Aaron Giles]

Added more instrumentation and added some extra paranoia to the
winwork code. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed some incorrect code in the ADSP2100 external flag handling.
[Aaron Giles]

Created new module polynew.c which combines triangle setup, 
rasterization, and Voodoo-like multiprocessor support. Coverted
Gaelco3D, Midway V-Unit, Namco System 22, and Voodoo drivers over 
to the new system. [Aaron Giles]

Added threadid parameter to work item callbacks. This allows for 
keeping per-thread information by the callbacks. [Aaron Giles]
