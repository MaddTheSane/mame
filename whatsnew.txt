Source Changes
--------------
Fixed and cleaned up the DIP switches in the dec0 driver.
[Roberto Fresca]

More improvements to the PGM video code. Also added hooks for halting
the sound CPU which allows ddp2 to boot. [David Haywood] 

Fixed incorrect lightgun names. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed Bonze Adventure levels 2 & 9. [Bryan McPhail]

Refactored the 8530 CIA code from the Amiga into a separate module
and made it support both the 6526 and 8530 variants. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed/improved DIP switches in the megasys1, dietgo, and yunsun16
drivers. [Twisty]

Fixed some DIP switches and added controls for 2nd player in cocktail 
mode in Lost Castle in Darkmist. [Sonikos]

Fixed a number of issues in the Windows rendering code:
[Giuseppe Gorgoglione]
 * fixed blit_vectors so it used the dirty pixel array in D3D mode
 * fixed blit_vectors rotation issue for dirty pixels as well
 * changed -full_screen_brightness to -full_screen_gamma
    (which is a more correct description)
 * changed -d3dfilter to be a boolean, since the other filtering modes
    are either obsolete or not applicable to MAME
 * removed limitations on windowing position so you no longer need to
    be aligned on an 8-pixel boundary
 * cleaned up a number of unused global variables
 * improved multi-monitor support to work in GDI mode as well as in
    non-full-screen modes
 * added missing documentation for the -screen parameter

Fixed some remaining errors and inconsistencies in the content and 
usage of MAME header files by comparing declarations against actual
definitions. Removed many orphaned/duplicate declarations. Added
#includes where appropriate, and moved a few declarations to another
file when they were in the wrong location. [Atari Ace]

Removed a number of unused ROM regions. Most (but not all) of the
empty ROM region warnings are now taken care of. Also uncommented/
added missing undumped ROMs/XORs in the Namco and CPS2 games.
[Aaron Giles]
 
More Amiga cleanups: [Aaron Giles]
 * fixed dual playfield mode
 * rewrote blitter code (fixes glitches in ar_bowl and others)
 * changed Arcadia boot loading to use ROMtags instead of autoconfig
 * swapped Kickstart 1.2 in for Arcadia BIOS (fixes ar_sdwr)

Source Changes
--------------
Fixed Monster World DIP switches. [Sonikos]

Fixed floating point rounding error in the PowerPC FPU. [Ville Linde]

Some more work on the Killing Blade protection. [El Semi]

Reorganized and cleaned up the PGM sprite drawing code a bit. Added
zooming support. [David Haywood]

Did some cleanup on the 6821 PIA functions, converting to new MAME
struct conventions and enforcing that configuration/initialization
happens only at init time. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed some unknown DIP switches in Galivan and Dangar Ufo Robo.
[Twisty]

Some improvements to Playmark's Roulette, though it still doesn't
quite work properly. [David Haywood]

Fixed Showdown start button. [Don Maeby]

Fixed sound frequency in Shocking. [Brian Troha, Guru]

Fixes to Top Roller: [Tomasz Slanina]
 - correct colors
 - fixed gfx bugs
 - better audio (added rom with samples)
There's still minor problem with fg text layer colors.

Made "This game doesn't work" text more explicit. [Olivier Galibert]

Added PAIR and PAIR64 as valid save state types. [Nathan Woods]

More Amiga/Arcadia system updates: [Aaron Giles]
 - Rewrote autoconfig system to be more generically useful
 - Cleaned up/rewrote the CIA emulation to be more complete
 - Added dual playfield and sprite priority support
 - Added collision detection support
 - Tweaked COPPER timing to fix scores on Fast Break
 - Shuffled the BIOSes so that the newer version is the default

metmqstr0105yel [Aaron Giles]



Source Changes
--------------
Cleaned up the usage of includes/*.h files across the project, by
ensuring that:
 1. All includes/foo.h files are annotated with comments describing 
     the source of the declarations.
 2. Each source file so annotated also explicitly does an
     #include "includes/foo.h" to ensure consistent definitions.
Along the way a number of inconsistent, irrelevant, and incomplete
declarations were removed/cleaned up. [Atari Ace]

Moved calls to ui_set_visible_area() into set_visible_area() to work
around timing problems when they are called at separate times during
a single frame. [Nathan Woods]

Updated CPS driver to more accurately draw tilemaps, based on
evidence from a board with mixed ROMs. [David Haywood]

Fixed crash bug in old debugger introduced in the last release.
[Olivier Galibert]

Added demo sounds DIP switch to Pig Newton. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed DIP switches in gunmast, batlbubl. [Brian Troha]

Added simulated sound for tumbleb2 and pangpang. [David Haywood]

Added accessors for the CA2, CB2 and IRQ signals on the 6821 PIA.
[Nathan Woods]

Accurate C-Chip emulation in Bonze Adventure to fix protection 
problems (no more missing or made up data, all data extracted from 
working pcb). [Bryan McPhail]

Some cleanups to the Taito F3 naming. [Marco, Bryan McPhail]

Fixed the Z80 PIO code to prevent an interrupt to occur between the 
PIO_OP_MODE byte and mask which follows. According to the datasheet, 
this is not permitted in hardware. [Robert]

Added many FPU opcodes to the M68040 core. [Ville Linde]

Fixed rom loading in all Taito JC games. [Ville Linde]

Added TMS320C51 cpu core. [Ville Linde]

Split out some of the Nintendo 64 core pieces into MESS-shareable
modules. [R. Belmont]

Removed hard linkage of game driver clones. This reduces hard 
inter-driver dependencies and allows for easier usage of tiny.mak.
[Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Updates to the PGM driver: [El Semi]
 - Corrected mask on sprite width parameter in sprite list
 - Corrected decryption function for The Killing Blade
 - Fixed GFX Rom loading in The Killing Blade
 - Added set The Killing Blade (Taiwan?)
 - Added some WIP protection simulation for The Killing Blade
    (Taiwan?), game boots but at least one stage is broken

Added $(OBJ)/%.s target to the makefile for easy disassembly
analysis of generated code (you can also use the $(OBJ)/%.pp to
examine preprocessor output). [Nathan Woods]

Moved region and address space names out of the Windows-specific
code and into more common locations. [Olivier Galibert]

Fixed a bug with code comments that led to incorrect display for
long comments. [Andrew Gardner]

Added several missing H8 opcodes to the core and color DAC to 
lastfght.c. [Tomasz Slanina]

Changed -romident option so that it returns errorlevels based on how
many ROMs were identified (0=all files identified, 1=all files except
some non-ROM files identified, 2=some files identified, 3=no files
identified). [Aaron Giles]

Added stricter type checking for save state registrations (only works 
in gcc). [Aaron Giles]

Changed automatic ROM assignment logic in the memory system so that
it doesn't auto-assign out-of-bounds ROM regions. [Aaron Giles]

Changed memory save state registration so it doesn't register for
saving memory areas that overlap memory regions. This means that 
drivers which rely on extra memory regions for RAM will need to fix
that before supporting save. [Aaron Giles]

Modified a number of drivers that were using empty RAM regions for
RAM or which had extraneous memory regions. Most significant changes
were to the arcadia, nss, and stv drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Added a warning during validity checks to point out empty memory
regions. These should either be eliminated, or marked with an 
explicit fill value (ROMREGION_ERASE00 or ROMREGION_ERASEFF) to clear
the warnings. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote a large chunk of the Amiga emulation to support sound and
additional video modes/effects including extra half-bright mode, 
manual sprites, and mid-scanline changes. This is still a work
in progress. [Aaron Giles]
