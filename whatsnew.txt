Source Changes
--------------
Improved DIP switches in benberob. [Brian Troha]

Added support for real Bubble Bobble MCU. [Trinity, Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed track lookup implementation in Virtua Racing, bringing the
game much closer to playable. [Olivier Galibert]

Minor cleanup and speed hack removal in the konamigx.c [R. Belmont]

Improved magicfly driver. All graphics are properly decoded / banked 
now. [Roberto Fresca]

More improvements to the 6840 timer module. Updated the MPU4 driver
to the most recent implementation. Convert Cosmic Chasm over to
using the new system. [El Condor]

65816/377xx update: [R. Belmont]
 * Made block transfer instructions interruptable as they are on 
    both actual chips (previously a single opcode could eat >400,000 
    cycles with obvious consequences for interrupt timing)
 * M377xx block transfers move one less byte than the 65816, fixed

Adjusted the DAC sound level on the 2612 to something more 
reasonable. [David Haywood]

Taito JC update: [Ville Linde]
 * Some general improvements to the driver
 * Added some more opcodes to the TMS320C51 core

Improved the M2 driver so that the M2 kernel starts to boot, but it 
hangs quite soon due to some multiprocessor issues. [Ville Linde]

Updated several games' input ports to use IPT_BILL1 for bill 
acceptors. [ClawGrip]

Properly documented and connected the MCU code in the Namco System 1,
System 86, Baraduke, Pacland, and Sky Kid drivers. [Brian Troha]

Renamed "Native" views to "Pixel Aspect" views to avoid the confusion
that they are anything but artificial aspect ratios. [Aaron Giles]

Added beam width control to the UI sliders. [Aaron Giles]

More Zaxxon driver cleanups/fixes: [Aaron Giles]
 * fixed sound problems in Razmataz
 * corrected background and sprite positioning
 * fixed bugs introduced in sample handling
 * bootlegs and alternate versions work again
 * added state saving support to the Sega universal sound board

Added several common generic graphics layouts to vidhrdw/generic.c, 
for use by multiple drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option -video none which can be used for CPU benchmarking
without the overhead of the video system. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed remaining crashes in GDI/ddraw mode when drawing vector games.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed the -artwork option to avoid confusion. If you want to run
without any artwork, use -view standard instead. [Aaron Giles]

Added options -screen, -aspect, -resolution, and -view which apply
to all windows. These values can be individually overridden for each
specific window by using the existing -screen<n>, -aspect<n>,
-resolution<n>, and -view<n> options. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that caused the sound sampling code to not track changes in
the refresh rate. [Aaron Giles]

Began cleanup/rewrite of the Sega G-80 raster games. This is still
very much a WIP, so don't report any bugs: [Aaron Giles]
 * cleaned up input port handling similar to the G-80 vectors
 * proper clock and video speeds
 * reimplemented Space Odyssey background including collision detect
 * fully implemented Pig Newton background
 * connected 2-board Monster Bash more correctly

Added new macro PORT_SERVICE_DIPLOC for specifying a PORT_SERVICE
and a DIPLOCATION. [Aaron Giles]

savestate0104u7ora [Adam Bousley]
ripoff097gre [Adam Bousley]
cuebrckj0104u2gra_fix [Canim]



Source Changes
--------------
Massive cleanup/fixing of 16-bit Sega drivers: [AWJ]
 * many corrections to descriptive set names, adding revision letters,
    cabinet types, etc.
 * fixed many DIP switches and added PORT_DIPLOCATION support
 * adjusted min/max values for analog controls to improve response
 * fixed button ordering between System 16A/B
 * cleaned up a number of ROM names and fixed some incorrect guesses
 * some cleanup of turbo.c as well
 * fixed visible area in Hang-On hardware
 * actually disabling 8751 in games that have a fake replacement
 * hooked up 8255 PPI correctly now that it has mode 2 support
 * fixed behavior of NMI line in later sega sound boards
 * fixed addressing in the SegaPCM sound system
 * some hardware/documentation cleanup

Some cleanups in the new UI/video code to make MESS happy.
[Nathan Woods]

Added macros to prevent use of strcasecmp and strncasecmp for
better cross-platform compatibility. [Nathan Woods]

Connected unimplemented opcode $01 on the 6809 core. [Antoine Mine]

Implemented CNT pin and some serial features of the 6526 CIA chip.
[Nathan Woods]

Mapped service button in slammast. [Canim]

Fixed bug in 8039 CPU handling of A11 latch. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote Zaxxon driver from the schematics. This is still a WIP (not
finished yet): [Aaron Giles]
 * correct clock speeds and video timing
 * complete memory maps
 * connected universal sound board to Ixion and Razmataz
 * simplified video code and merged common cases together
 * palette derived from resistor weights
 * background positioning still a little off

Added service_coin_lockout_w() to lockout service coins. [Aaron Giles]

Added MDRV_SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS() which lets you specify a pixel clock,
horizontal, and vertical video timing values in place of the usual
screen size, visible area, refresh rate, and VBLANK timing values.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that prevented save/restore from working in the UI.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed mode selection logic so that refresh is weighted more strongly
when picking a mode. This allows you to specify -resolution 0x0@60 to
force MAME to pick a 60Hz screen refresh while allowing it to choose
the best resolution. [Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------
Removed hard core dependency on samples. [Andrew Gardner]

Added what seems to be a proper fix for the background transparency 
flag that was needed by champbwl to show the green background.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Updates to the MagicFly driver: [Robert Fresca]
 - Figured out the MC6845 (mapped at $0800-$0801)
 - Fixed the screen size based on MC6845 registers.
 - Fixed the visible area based on MC6845 registers.
 - Corrected the gfx rom region.
 - Solved the NMI/vblank issue. Now attract works.
 - Changed CPU clock to 625khz.
 - Added new findings to the technical notes.
 - Marked magicfly PAL as NO_DUMP (read protected).

Fixed memory write ordering bug in the 68000 core. [Charles MacDonald]

Added some PPC602 specific opcodes and registers. [Ville Linde]

Removed NEW_RENDER definition and all support for the old rendering
system from the core. Cleaned up a bunch of useless and deprecated
code as a result. [Aaron Giles]

Massively rewrote the user interface to rely on the new rendering
systems. Broke the UI into multiple pieces (ui.c, uimenu.c, uigfx.c).
The code is now verging on readable. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed ui_popup to popmessage across the code, and implemented
popmessage in mame.c. This breaks the dependency between the core 
driver code and the user interface in almost all cases. [Aaron Giles]

Added a red background to serious warning messages in the vain hope
that people might take better notice. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed vector game crashes with DirectDraw rendering. [Aaron Giles]

Consolidated live screen parameters into a screen_state structure.
Machine->visible_area[num] is now Machine->screen[num].visarea.
Machine->refresh_rate[num] is now Machine->screen[num].refresh.
[Aaron Giles]

Added new function configure_screen() which can control the width,
height, visible area, and refresh rate of each screen. This function
allows for widths and heights larger than what were specified in the
game driver, so you no longer have to specify the maximum width and
height in the driver, but can instead specify a typical width and
height. This function supercedes the old set_visible_area() and
set_refresh_rate() functions. The former has been rewritten to call
configure_screen(), while the latter has been removed entirely.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed the behavior for supporting overscan and other effects. The
width and height of a screen control the overall bitmap size. The
visible area of a screen specify its non-blanked boundaries (and 
default visible area, as before). [Aaron Giles]

Moved line-to-quad conversion routine into the core render.c as
another utility function. [Aaron Giles]
