Source Changes
--------------
Merged in a couple of minor tweaks from MAME Plus! [MAME Plus!]

Fixed China Gate high scores. [Robbert]

Fixed Final Lap R/Speed Racer graphics. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added a new opcode for Match It 2. There still are 4 unknown opcodes 
and the "no tiles" bug before it will be promoted to working status.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Changed the CRTC6845 emulator to optionally control the screen 
configuration and video rendering. Updated the Qix and Spiders driver 
to use the new functionality. Added notifications for when the
display enable pin changes in order to drive blanking signals.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

New 74123 timer emulator. It supports different ways a 74123 can be 
hooked up that affect the timing period. The old implementation was 
incorrect in lots of respects. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Removed the addressing order parameter from pia_config() and replaced
it with dedicated write and read handlers. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Rewrote nyny driver: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - Game speed should now be correct. It was way too slow before
 - Added star field. The game can stop and reverse the direction of 
    the star field by changing a delay counter
 - General driver clean-up
 - Fixed DIP switches and the voices

Fixed bug in win_get_window_text_utf8() for when a window's text is 
an empty string. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed some page 1 opencode lengths in the 6309 dissasembler.
[Tim Lindner]

Added DIP switches to Master Boy according to the game manual.
[ClawGrip]

Added DIP switch information to the Poizone driver. [Luigi30]

Changed png2bdc to support multiple input PNGs. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed recently introduced bug in Astrocade driver relating to
collision detection. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for controlling the default scale/offset for screens
at the driver level. This allows us to properly describe the screen
width/height and blanking in the driver independent of specifying a
good default size to crop the image to. [Aaron Giles]

Added border support to the Astrocade driver. Extended the starfield
generation out into it. Extended the blanking region out farther to
match information from the flyers and set the default scale/offset
of the games to crop appropriately. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed the CDP1869 to fill the border area with the background color.
Added cropping to the Cidelsa games. [Aaron Giles]

Corrected speaker locations and placement for Gorf and Wizard of Wor.
Added missing mux to Gorf's audio, which controls speech versus
sound effects during the game. [Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------
Added support for playback of "extended" INP files that are commonly
found on compete sites. [David Haywood]

Added lswx and stswx opcodes to the PowerPC core. [Ville Linde]

Changed DRIVER_INIT macro to prepend driver_init_* instead of simply
init_* to be consistent with the other initialization functions.
[Atari Ace]

Corrected the pulse shape of the timer output in the MPU4 driver,
and also correctly identified the AY sound chip as an AY8913.
[James Wallace]

Merged leprechn driver into the gameplan driver and added correct
video timings. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Cleaned up the dorachan driver. Replaced fake color map with actual
color PROM decoding. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Cleaned up the supertnk driver. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Move Atari vector PROMs into separate regions. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Added DIP switches for Excite League. [Barry Harris, Yasuhiro Ogawa]

Improved m92 sprite drawing. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Rewrote the magicfly driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Figured out how the protection works.
 - Removed the hacks/patchs that formerly allow boot the games.
 - Figured out how the buffered inputs works.
 - Demuxed all inputs for both games.
 - Unified the memory maps from both games.
 - Added NVRAM support to both games.
 - Mapped DIP switches.
 - Managed the planes to get the 3bpp GFX colors accurate.
 - Renamed the ROMs acording to pcb pictures and ROM contents.
 - Cleaned up and optimized the driver.

Fixed throttle range in gforce2. [David Haywood]

Moved Win32 UTF-8 wrappers into a new module (winutf8.c), and added 
some new wrappers that Oliver Stoeneberg created for MAME32.
[Nathan Woods]

Aleck64/N64 update: [Ryan Holtz]
 - RSP: some opcodes bugfixed plus should work on big-endian targets
 - Real PIF ROM dump now used and required
 - Various other fixes

Fixed eeprom handling in surfplnt. [couriersud]

Fixed carry flag calculation for SUB/SBC/CMP family instructions in
the ARM core. [R. Belmont, Ryan Holtz]

Improvements to the ARM7 core: [R. Belmont, Ryan Holtz]
 - fixed 32-bit unaligned reads to "scramble" properly
 - fixed carry flag calc for SUB/SBC/CMP family instructions
 - fixed multiply-and-accumulate instructions
 - added more instructions to the disassembler
 - fixed logical and arithmetic shifts
 - added more Thumb instructions
 - fixed relative loads and stores
 - fixed LSL/LSR with zero shift values
 - fixed the disassembly of CMN
 - verified behavior when ADD destination is the PC on real h/w

Rewrote the Space Firebird driver: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - Added star field, matches with the screen shot perfectly
 - Video timings/memory map/interrupts from schematics
 - Added support for the color fade effect

Identified a couple of new opcodes in the Irem V30 CPU which improves
matchit2. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Significantly cleaned up the Spiders driver. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Changed memory system behavior so that masks can be specified 
independently of mirrors. By default if the mask is 0 and a mirror
is present, the mask is implicitly ~mirror, just as before. But if a
mask is specified, it is not limited to the non-mirrored bits. This
allows you to independently control the mapping versus what is 
returned to the read/write handler. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote Astrocade driver: [Aaron Giles]
 - fully implemented all function generator modes
 - implemented pattern board according to schematics, including timing
 - fixed interrupt handling
 - added crosshairs to SeaWolf II
 - added stereo sound and panning to SeaWolf II samples
 - rewrote Astrocade sound emulation according to patent
 - sound generation now uses proper LFSR for noise effects
 - added partial support for Ten Pin Deluxe, including sound board
    emulation and internal layout

Fixed sound in Inferno after all these years. Sadly, it required a
hack. [Aaron Giles]

Added correct video timings for the Williams games. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for misaligned PIXBLT operations in the TMS34010 core.
The code still needs cleanup but improves the new JPM driver.
