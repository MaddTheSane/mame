Source Changes
--------------
Fixed options_output_ini_file() and options_output_ini_mame_file() 
to properly handle string options containing spaces. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed incorrect DIP switches in Trivia (Version 1.03), Selection,
and Poker games (getrivia.c). [wolf676]

Added PORT_DIPLOCATION macros to a number of drivers based on 
research. [Roberto Fresca]

Fixed several issues with pausing and the multithreading code.
[Nathan Woods]

Cleaned up the vacfdisp module to display 14 and 16 segment displays.
Added a separate character set for the OKI MSC1937. Changes Scorpion
2 to the new system. Tidied up the 6840 emulator a bit. [El Condor]

Attempted to fix the bad Space Odyssey ROM by using data from the
previous dump. It is still marked BAD_DUMP (we would like to get an
actual dump), but the new Space Odyssey is now playable. [MASH]

Removed recently-introduced case dependency in the ROM naming.
[Buddabing]

Added new option -multithreading (-mt) which enables the previous
multithreaded rendering code. This code has had problems on some
systems, especially pre-XP systems, so consider it experimental. If
you want to help debug issues, enable LOG_THREADS in windows/window.c
and post them to MAMETesters.org with a description of your problem
and your system. If you don't have hyperthreading, dual core, or a
multi-CPU system, don't bother turning this flag on. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the behavior of the led7seg primitive. It now no longer takes
a state value but accepts states from 0-255, allowing independent
control over all 7 segments and the decimal. Ordered the segments
according to standard order. Updated the Turbo driver to do its own
BCD decoding via an LS48 decoder to control the segments directly.
This will break existing layouts using the led7seg primitive. 
[Aaron Giles]

Further turbo driver cleanup. Still in WIP. [Aaron Giles]
 * derived sprite scaling from PROMs and R/C values (still not 100%)
 * rewrote most of the video/sprite handling
 * identified all PROMs and used them where appropriate
 * added a more complete 8279 implementation
 * converted 7-segment LEDs to the new behavior described above

Source Changes
--------------
Fixed some DIP switches in bigrun and wildplt, and changed UK region
to Europe in f1gpstar and f1gpstr2. [Sonikos]

TIA-MC1 improvements: [Eugene Sandulenko]
 - More documentation
 - fixed inputs
 - fixed video framerate and VSYNC delay
 - adjusted CPU freq according to documentation
 - removed hack with off-board video RAM
 - implemented sound
 - added NO_DUMP PROMs

Improved documentation in the asteroids and tempest drivers.
[Brian Troha]

Improved DIP switches and documentation in the Championship Bowling
driver. [Brian Troha]

Major cleanup/rewrite of the NES PPU rendering code. [Brad Oliver]

Fixed protection in the world version of Virtua Bowling. [Brian Troha]

Fixed collision detection in Halley's Comet '87. [Brian Troha]

Added missing DIP switch to Hangman driver. [Wolfi]

Added a callback to the 68000 emulator for the TAS instruction,
which allows different implementations based on external hardware.
[David Haywood]

Namco System 22 update: [R. Belmont]
 - Fixed ROM loading problems reported by Guru
 - Hooked up Prop Cycle fan and lamp to the new output system

Added new flag: VIDEO_ALWAYS_UPDATE, which causes the VIDEO_UPDATE
callback to be called even on skipped frames. This should be used
for games where the process of rendering has side effects such as
collision detection that need to always be present. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed the new scanline timing functions to compute things
correctly and without using unnecessary timers. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed inputs in the Sega G80 vector games which were broken in the
last release cycle. [Aaron Giles]

Began cleanup/rewrite of the Turbo driver: [Aaron Giles]
 - proper video timings
 - full memory map
 - cleanup/simplification of the video code with better documentation
 - some things are still broken, this is a WIP
