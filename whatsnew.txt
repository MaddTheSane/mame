Source Changes
--------------
Improved the cidelsa driver: [Curt Coder]
 - rewrote the cdp1802 cpu emulation as a state machine
 - fixed Draco dips and inputs (what a strange game!)
 - added NVRAM to Destroyer/Draco (Altair has no battery on the PCB)
 - fixed some clocks

Fixed mapping of spaceship controls in spcenctr. [Canim]

Removed the inclusion of unnecessary header files across the project.
[Atari Ace]

Added discrete filters to the new Namco 54xx sound effects. Also
implemented filters for the 52xx sound effects in preparation for
future changes. [Derrick Renaud]

Added pause support to the output system: [Bob Seidel]
 - added "pause" message through the Output system to let clients 
    know when MAME is paused
 - the state of an item is now sent when the item is first created
 - updated ledutil to use the pause state

Added cocktail mode and DIP locations to the Millipede driver.
[Mike Haaland]

Many more CPS2 keys added. Removed all XORs and support for them from
MAME. [Nicola Salmoria, Andreas Naive]

Fixed regression in the ar_xeon driver sprites. [Ernesto Corvi]

Kaneko driver improvements:
 - bloodwar: [Gary Walkling, Sebastien Volpe]
    * protection data extracted, still needs to be verified
    * collision detection simulation thanks to tests on real board
 - bonkadv: [Guru, Sebastien Volpe]
    * protection data fully verified: corrects tilemap colors in levels 2 and 3
    * correct implementation of MCU command 43

Fixed behavior of MOVEC instruction on later 680x0 chips, and in the
disassembler. [Ernesto Corvi]

Properly idenitified sound ROMs for Altered Beast set 2. [Brian Troha]

Fixed bad bits in a couple of FD1094 keys. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug in debugger that caused incorrect end offsets to be 
computed on CPUs with an address shift. [Ville Linde]

Moved some additional pieces of core functionality in the the core
utility library. [Nathan Woods]

Added sound to porky. [Tomasz Slanina]

Changed font scaling again. Fonts 24 pixels tall and above are scaled
the old way. Fonts smaller than that are scaled via integral scale
factors and adjusted the new way. [Aaron Giles]

Added a small optimization to the FD1094 decoding step. [Aaron Giles]

Added several new modules to the utility library libutil. First is a
generic huffman encoding module. Second is a module that allows you to
read/write AVI files in a platform-independent way. And third is a
lossless A/V compression module. These three pieces together, plus
some changes in the CHD code, allow for the creation of CHDs with
compressed audio and video. [Aaron Giles]

Added two new commands to chdman: -createav converts an AVI file in
uncompressed YUY format or HuffYUV-compressed YUY format with "left"
prediction into a CHD. And -extractav converts a CHD containing
compressed audio & video into an uncompressed YUY format AVI file.
[Aaron Giles]

Finished hooking up laserdisc support to the new audio/video 
compression. Note that we still do not have canonical CHDs of
laserdisc data at the moment, but all the support is now present for
when they start to appear. [Aaron Giles]

IMPORTANT: This release brings with it a major source code 
reorganization. Because of this, there is no diff update, since the
diff would be enormous.

The new layout at a high level looks like this:

makefile
docs/
src/
  emu/        (generic emulation files from the old src/ directory)
    cpu/      (CPU cores from src/cpu)
    sound/    (sound cores from src/sound)
    debug/    (debugger code from src/debug)
    audio/    (generic audio files from src/sndhrdw)
    layout/   (generic layout files from src/layout)
    machine/  (generic machine files from src/machine)
    video/    (generic video files from src/vidhrdw)

  mame/       (MAME-specific drivers)
    drivers/  (drivers from src/drivers)
    includes/ (includes from src/includes)
    layout/   (majority of files from src/layout)
    machine/  (majority of files from src/machine)
    audio/    (majority of files from src/sndhrdw)
    video/    (majority of files from src/vidhrdw)
    etc/      (misc files from src/etc)

  lib/        (libraries)
    util/     (various files with light dependencies from src)
    zlib/     (zlib library)
    expat/    (expat library)

  osd/        (OS-dependent code)
    osdmini/  (mini OS-dependent code)
    windows/  (Windows OS-dependent code)

  tools/      (misc tools)

Along with these changes come a number of makefile alterations to
better distribute the build knowledge within each major subdirectory.
There may be some build issues or other interesting side effects to
this change. Report them on MAMETesters and future updates will
include fixes.



MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
m4_0111u4gra [Mike Ellery]
mouser0112yel [Mamesick]
bnj0111u5ora [Canim]



Source Changes
--------------
Improvements to the Cidelsa driver: [Curt Coder]
 - Fixed the disassembly of cdp1802 opcode LSKP
 - Changed the cdp1802 opcode OUT to increment R(X) after calling the 
    write handler
 - Set cdp1869 display size and visible area according to data sheet
 - Added cdp1869 CFC emulation (probably never used by anything but 
   just for completeness' sake)
 - Cleaned up driver

Improvements to the M2 driver: [Ville Linde]
 - Added preliminary CD controller emulation
 - Hooked up some more multi-processor functionality and interrupts

Improvements to C352 sound emulator: [cync, hoot development team]
 - Rewrote loop and flag handling, added support for global key-on 
    register
 - Fixed state saving

Worked around compilation error on MSVC that caused "Calendar error"
in the Neo Geo games. [Atari Ace]

Rewrote much of the RF5C400 sound emulator to support looping, stereo
panning, and 8-bit sample support.
[hoot development team, Ville Linde]

Removed patch from mjleague now that it is not needed. 
[Arenzo Fabrice]

Fixed bubbletr crosshairs. [Canim]

Cleaned up information in mamedriv.c. [Brian Troha]

Added save state support for all games in gng.c, gunsmoke.c, lasso.c, 
solomon.c and terracre.c. [Vas Crabb]

Replaced implementation of Namco 54xx sound chip with new MB8844 CPU
core running the original embedded ROM code. Removed old sound core.
Pole Position and Bosconian no longer require samples as a result.
[Nicola Salmora, Ernesto Corvi, Guru]

Added new function driver_get_count() to return the number of drivers.
[Nathan Woods]

Added a bunch of new protection routines for SD Gundam & Heated 
Barrel. [Angelo Salese]

Input system changes: [Derrick Renaud]
 - Added new IPT_POSITIONAL control type. This is for Ikari type 
    rotary controls and gray-code devices like Seawolf. This makes 
    rotary and gray-code controls easy to enter without custom 
    handlers.
 - Fixed some rounding and min/max errors in the core input code.
 - Modified crosshair code to be based on real scaling, see Seawolf 
    for an example. It can now also have multiple crosshairs on one 
    input port if needed.
 - Added back in the namcos2 crosshairs. Turns out they are needed 
    for calibration.
 - Removed the gwar control hack from the Ikari games that did not 
    need it. Modified the gwar control hack so it is only used for 1 
    frame, making it unnoticeable.
 - Updated boothill, gunfight, seawolf, spcenctr to use the new 
    PORT_REMAP_TABLE.

Fixed the exidy/stern-sb1000 6840-based sound hardware to use what 
is believed (based on the schematic) to be the proper LFSR/PRNG 
waveform for its secondary clock source. [Lord Nightmare]

Updated Dragon Bowl to use HOLD_LINE for sound IRQs. Also did the same
for the following drivers: afega, ettrivia, funybubl, jack, mustache,
seta, trvmadns, wink. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Changed 6809/6309 CPU cores to call the MAME debugger when CWAI/SYNC
is used. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed uninitialized use of video_dma_address to address the rfjet
crash in 64-bit builds. [Ville Linde]

Added support for the Motorola MPC8240 to the PowerPC core.
[Ville Linde]

Improved ZIP file searching to look first for name + CRC match, second
for CRC-only match, and lastly for name-only match. [Ben Rudiak-Gould]

Verified and improved stepper behavior based on comparison with a
real machine. [James Wallace]

Changed file2str to work for any binary file and output the data as
an array of bytes rather than a string. [Aaron Giles]

Made UI font size computations more flexible. This ensures that fonts
are scaled vertically by an integral factor and should produce nice
proportions for most fonts now. [Aaron Giles]

Added new function sound_find_sndnum_by_tag() to look up a sound
index by its tag. [Aaron Giles]

Made osd_uchar_from_osdchar a member of the osdcore file library.
[Aaron Giles]

Created new generic bitmap management code with fewer dependencies on
the rest of MAME so that it can be used by utility code. Changed 
bitmap_alloc to always take a format parameter. Deprecated
bitmap_alloc_format. Updated all drivers to pass an explicit format
when allocating a bitmap. Changed auto_bitmap_alloc in the same
fashion. [Aaron Giles]

Split some functionality from fileio.c into new module corefile.c,
which can be used by utilities to get unicode support and fopen-style
file I/O built on top of the OSD routines. Rebuilt fileio.c on top of
the core file code. Added mame_core_file() to get the underlying
core_file object from a mame_file so it can be used with png and
xmlfile code. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the way the tiny build works. There is now the concept of a
SUBTARGET. By default SUBTARGET is set equal to TARGET (which is mame)
and everything builds as normal. The makefile that is included is now
src/$(TARGET)/$(SUBTARGET).mak. Thus, to do a tiny build, you now
have to specify "make SUBTARGET=tiny". This will produce an output 
executable with a name $(TARGET)$(SUBTARGET) (mametiny in this case).
[Aaron Giles]

Turned ENABLE_BORDER_PIX back on, since so many people seem to be
having trouble without it. [Aaron Giles]
