Source Changes
--------------
* Changed v60 CPU to clock multiple cycles per instruction instead of requiring
every driver to divide the clock; updated all drivers to use the correct clock
speed. [Aaron Giles]

* Made the expression engine in the debugger a little more generic to support
its use in other tools. [Aaron Giles]

Type dipswitch in Street Heat. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

* Added proper C-chip emulation to Operation Wolf. [Bryan McPhail]

* Major update to Namco System 21 driver [Phil Stroffolino]

  - Starblade is working with emulated master/slave DSPs.  Graphic updates
  are a bit choppy; I believe there are 4 slaves and one master on the
  real PCB, with work distributed across the slaves.  Some background
  objects are still missing in Starblade - the giant "starships" in the
  background of the first stage, for example (sprites are present showing
  burning fires which are supposed to be superimposed on them).  The
  "direct drawing" feature is used during the high score presentation;
  colors are likely wrong, and there are missing graphics there as well
  (hexagons).

  - Solvalou works, but occasionally 3d graphics stop updating; press "A"
  to unblock the pipeline and resume drawing them.

  - The other System 21 titles are not working for various reasons. 
  Solvalou needed cuskey support (used from the master DSP).  Cybersled
  appears to use a different mechanism for uploading DSP code.

* Fixed road colors in the Suzuka games. [Phil Stroffolino]

* Added home/end key support in the history display. [Samuele Zannoli]

* Added debugger suppot for the decrementer register in the PowerPC
core. [Nathan Woods]

* Implemented column scroll in TC0100SCN chip; used on (at least)
Ninja Kids, Gun Frontier, Growl and Galemedes. [Bryan McPhail]

* Added ADSP-21062 core and partially hooked it up for the Model 2B
games. [Ville Linde]

* Additional progress on the PowerPC DRC (faster), support for
more exceptions, better support for the PPC internal serial ports.
[Ville Linde]

* Progress on the Konami PowerPC drivers [Ville Linde]
  - Cleaned up and consolidated common hardware
  - Hooked up ADSP-21062 and 3dfx chips
  - Initial reverse-engineering work on the KS001005
  custom 3D chipset in GTI Club
  - Initial NVRAM values plugged in for many games. 
  (They're used as a crude protection, similar to the
  EEPROM on GV System).
  - No games are playable or even show much yet, but
  nearly all of them do pass POST now.

* Fixed a minor bug in the SCSP timer handling. [Ville Linde]

* Fixed memory leak in the cpu subsystem. [Aaron Giles]
