Source Changes
--------------
Added raw decryption table to choko. Enabled the use of the large
CHD-based tables by default. [David Haywood]

Changed kram3 decryption to use external tables instead of hard-
coded ones in the source. [Atari Ace]

   - Moved video hardware to vidhrdw/gticlub.c
   - Hooked up sound emulation
   - Added dual-screen support for Hang Pilot

   - Improved Hang Pilot/NWK-TR gfx board emulation

STV fixes: [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
 - vdp2: fixed vertical scrolling for RGB bitmaps (fixes corrupted
    gfx in batmanfr)
 - vdp2: fixed vertical line scrolling for zoomed layers (fixes
    corrupted backgrounds in astrass)
 - stv:  added speedup for master sh2 in batmanfr

Fixed bug in overflow handling and SUBC emulation in the TMS32010
core. [Rainer Keuchel]

Reverted Mario Bros. graphics offset since it caused issues 
elsewhere. [Derrick Renaud]

Enhanced chd.c to support hunk sizes up to 16MB, versus the previous
64k limit. [Aaron Giles]

Added hooks to chd.c to specify codec-specific configuration info.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed obsolete timing parameter from stream_update(). [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up cdrom.c. Removed audio implementation and relocated code
into sound/cdda.c. Changed metadata format to be textual instead of
binary (old metadata format is still supported). Removed external
access to CHD positions; all accesses are now done at the physical
LBA level and converted internally. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for split CHD files. CHD files can be transparently
split into multiple pieces and left that way during read access.
Modifications to split files are always written to the last file.
A new command chdman -split is now available to split an existing
CHD file. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option -fontpath to control where the font files are loaded
from. [Aaron Giles]

Added ability for options_add_entries() to override defaults 
specified in the core. To do this, simply include an option in the
list with the same name as the core option and provide a new default.
This default will override the one specified in the core.
[Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------
Fixed flags access in the i286 core. [Barry Rodewald]

Updated MC146818 module to use new core date/time routines.
[Nathan Woods]

Cleaned up disassemblers to remove stubs and ensure the disassemblers
are not referenced except in debug builds. [Nathan Woods]

Added support for using CHDs to decrypt CPS2 games. This code is
disabled for the moment, but will be enabled in the future. Only a 
handful of games have complete tables so far. These tables are huge 
(~4GB) and uncompressable until the encryption algorithm is 
understood. [David Haywood]

Fixed bug in the debugger that caused watchpoints to not be active
until the next context switch. [smf]

Cleaned up the input definitions for n-way joysticks so they are
more explicit. Added concept of a "16-way" joystick, which is a
joystick that doesn't prevent simultaneous opposing directions from
bring reported. [smf]

Major System 573 update: [smf]
 * fixed PSX SIO control register behavior
 * implemented several SCSI CD commands: START/STOP UNIT, PAUSE/
    RESUME, READ SUB-CHANNEL, READ TOC
 * added uPD4701 emulation
 * fixed ATAPI reset, PIO, and command IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE 
 * hooked up controls for fishing, DRR, and Guitar Freaks games
 * hooked up CDDA audio
 * removed some unused bytes from the Konami 80's security chips

Fixed upside down service mode in the commando.c driver. [Canim]

Added support for the Triple Hunt 8-track audio. [Derrick Renaud]

Galaxian/Scramble driver reorganization: [Atari Ace]
 * machine/scramble.c is broken up into two files, 
    machine/galaxian.c and machine/scramble.c
 * drivers/amidar.c, drivers/frogger.c, drivers/scobra.c get copies 
    of some of the data structures they shared from other drivers 
 * galaxian_base is made static and uses outside of the main driver
    were rewritten
 * cclimber_decode code from drivers/cclimber.c was separated into 
    its own machine/cclimber.c file to allow mshuttle to share it 
    without taking on other dependencies

Added missing x-flipping support in Major Havoc. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Made some improvements to trivia madness driver. There still is 
something wrong in the question roms banking. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

More updates to the ST-V driver: [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
 * vdp1: added shading for sprites (used by znpwfv, cotton, others)
 * vdp1: fixed sprite clipping (fixes incorrect sprites in znpwfv)
 * vdp1: fixed transparency on colour lookup table sprites (fixes bad
          sprites in znpwfv)
 * vdp2: fixed caching of RGB layer (fixes bad backgrounds on bosses 
          in rsgun)
 * vdp2: added additive blending for tilemaps and sprites (rsgun)
 * vdp2: added vertical line scroll and linezoom (fixes diehard logo)
 * stv:  improved speedups for diehard
 * stv:  fixed speedups for znpwfv
 * stv:  added preliminary save state support

Significant cleanup of chd.c: [Aaron Giles]
 * got rid of the horrible last_error concept; now all routines 
    return an error directly
 * fixed several issues in managing metadata 
 * changed compression and verification routines to be client-driven 
    rather than monolithic
 * changed internal codec usage to be more flexible
 * altered chdman and MAME to use the new interfaces
 * added new -createraw command for creating raw data CHDs

Fixed crash bug in romcmp when comparing ZIP files. [Aaron Giles]

     edit screen.

Added support for Fixed Interval Timer to the PPC403 core.
[Ville Linde]

Polygonet Commanders update: [Andrew Gardner]
 * Added more accurate host interface to dsp56k core
 * Removed a bunch of hacks in plygonet.c

Added new field Machine->basename which is used to describe the path
used for various file accesses. This is a helper for MESS, and should
not have any user-visible changes. The file accesses affected are:
configuration (cfg) files, snapshots, debugger comments, NVRAM,
and memory cards. [Aaron Giles]

Changed naming of screenshots. They are now created in separate
folders per game, with numeric names 0000.png, 0001.png, etc.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed artwork layout loading to load either gamename/gamename.lay
or gamename/default.lay. The latter is preferred, and allows for
easier reuse of layouts between games. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed max instruction bytes for 68020+ CPUs to avoid assertion in
new disassembler. [Aaron Giles]

Added flip screen offsets needed with new video parameters in the
pacman.c driver. [Aaron Giles]
