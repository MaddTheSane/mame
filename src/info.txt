Description of the -listinfo output.
------------------------------------

Grammar:
--------
	start -> ENTRY*
	ENTRY -> ENTRYNAME ENTRYVALUE
	ENTRYNAME -> SYMBOL
	ENTRYVALUE -> SYMBOL | STRING | ENTRYLIST
	ENTRYLIST -> '(' ENTRY* ')'

	SYMBOL -> any char except separator, '"', '(', ')'
	STRING -> default C string in double quote ""

Any space (specifically any char which C function ispace() tells is a
space) is considered a separator and must be ignored.

How to read the file
--------------------
If you have the necessity to read the output of -listinfo option
you must do attention of these issues:

1) You can't do any assumption of space indentation.
2) You can't do any assumption of max line length. All output can be
   in a very long line.
3) You can't do any assumption of order of the entries.
4) You can't do any assumption of the presence of any entry except the
   game.name and resource.name which are mandatory and unique.
5) You must skip entry unknow.
6) Spaces are required only for separing SYMBOL.
7) Lists of entry empty are valid.

For example:

game(description"Pac Man (Midway)"unknowentry()name pacman rom(name pacman.6e size 4096 crc c1e6ab10)rom( ...

is a valid output.
