(1) Needs samples provided separately



10 Yard Fight ("yard")
======================
Clones supported:
  Vs. version ("vsyard")

Known issues:
- Vs. mode runs only in cocktail mode (second player controls inverted).
  That's probably how the game is designed.



1942 ("1942")
=============
Clones supported:
  alternate version, almost identical ("1942a")
  another version ("1942b")

Known issues:
- Sometimes "1942a" ends in an endless loop over the sea, and the end of level
  boss doesn't appear. It hasn't been verified whether "1942" and "1942b" do the
  same; "1942" might be a later release that fixes this bug.



1943 ("1943")
=============
Clones supported:
  Japanese version ("1943jap")

Known issues:
- Colors in test mode are not correct, but the board the PROMs were read from
  does the same. The colors in the game seem to be correct.
- To be able to access items 4-7 in the test menu, you must keep 3 pressed
  while pressing F3.



4D Warriors ("4dwarrio")
========================
Known issues:
- Sound hangs after you die.



720 Degrees ("720")
===================
Clones supported:
  earlier version ("720b")

Known issues:
- The controller isn't emulated properly.



Aero Fighters ("aerofgt")
=========================
Keep button 1 pressed during boot to have access to a wider range of options
in service mode.



Alpine Ski ("alpine")
=====================
Clones supported:
  alternate (bootleg?) version, with different protection ("alpinea")

Known issues:
- Collision detection is not emulated properly.



Amidar ("amidar")
=================
Clones supported:
  Japanese version ("amidarjp"). This version has a worse attract mode and
                                 does not display the number of jumps left.
  bootleg version called Amigo ("amigo")
  version running on Scramble hardware ("amidars")



Anteater ("anteater")
=====================
Known issues:
- cocktail mode doesn't work. This might well be a bug in the original.



Arabian ("arabian")
===================
In test mode, to test sound press 1 and 2 player start simultaneously.
2 players start + Button 1 will take you to the color test screen. Then hit
1 + Button 1 to go to the level test screen.  Button 1 will take you to the
next screen from then on.



Arkanoid ("arkanoid")
=====================
Clones supported:
  US version ("arknoidu")
  bootleg ("arkbl2")
  Tayto bootleg, not using the 68705 microcontroller ("arkatayt")

Known issues:
- Due to features of the 68705 not emulated yet, the "arkbl2" bootleg set
  doesn't work.
- There might also be protection related problems in "arknoidu" (later levels
  corrupted).
- Since it doesn't have to emulate the 68705, the Tayto bootleg is faster than
  the other versions.
- Dual paddle in cocktail mode is not supported.



Armored Car ("armorcar")
========================
Press the second player button #2 (default: S) + F3 to enter test mode

Clones supported:
  alternate version ("armorca2")



Astro Blaster ("astrob")
========================
Clones supported:
  version 1 ("astrob1")
To quote from Clay Cowgill's page ( http://wwwpro.com/clay/roms_stuff.html )
about the version 1 ROMs:

This ROM set appears to be the "original" Astro Blaster ROMs. There are no
on-screen instructions and the progression of waves is very difficult. I
believe they were replaced by version 2 (below) to make the game a little
easier. The game behaves a little differently than version 2 when starting
up-- the more coins you put in, the more ships you get to start with.



Atari Basketball ("bsktball")
=============================
The original hardware uses the Player 1 and Player 2 Start buttons
as the Jump/Shoot buttons.  I've taken button 1 and mapped it to the Start
buttons to keep people from getting confused.



Astro Fighter ("astrof")
========================
	Astro Fighter Sets:

    The differences are minor. From newest to oldest:

	Main Set: 16Kbit ROMs
	          Green/Hollow empty fuel bar.
			  60 points for every bomb destroyed.

	Set 2:    8Kbit ROMs
			  Blue/Solid empty fuel bar.
			  60 points for every bomb destroyed.

	Set 3:    8Kbit ROMs
			  Blue/Solid empty fuel bar.
			  300 points for every seven bombs destroyed.

Known issues:
- The background is blue. It was black in all the original boards checked, but
  there is no obvious bug in the emulation.



Bagman ("bagman")
=================
Clones supported:
  Stern license ("bagmans")
  other Stern license, older ("bagmans2")



Battlezone ("bzone")
====================
Clones supported:
  alternate version ("bzone2")

There are two control methods:
  1) E,I,D,K,Space: Close to the original controls (two up/down sticks)
  2) Arrow keys+CTRL: simulates a 4-way joystick



Berzerk ("berzerk")
===================
Clones supported:
  earlier, very rare version ("berzerk1")



Bio Attack ("bioatack")
=======================
Known issues:
- Collision detection doesn't work.



Black Tiger ("blktiger")
========================
Clones supported:
  Japanese version, Black Dragon ("blkdrgon")
  bootleg version ("bktigerb")
  bootleg Black Dragon with the protection removed and hacked to say "Black
    Tiger" on the title screen ("blkdrgnb")



Blaster ("blaster")
===================
The first time you run the game, it will say "factory settings restored".
Press F2 to proceed.

F2 tests
F1+F2 bookkeeping/setup



Bomb Jack ("bombjack")
======================
Press fire to skip the ROM/RAM test at the beginning.

In the dip switch menu, DIFFICULTY 1 refers to the speed of the mechanical
bird, while DIFFICULTY 2 to the number and speed of enemies.
SPECIAL refers to how often the (E) and (S) coins appear.

Known issues:
- There is a bit in the sprite attributes which I don't know what means:
  it seems to be set only when the (B) materializes.
- The INITIAL HIGH SCORE setting doesn't only set that, it does something
  else as well - but I don't know what.



Boot Hill ("boothill")
======================
The mouse aims the gun



Bosconian ("bosco")
=====================
Midway copyright

Clones supported:
  Namco copyright ("bosconm")

Known issues:
- some of the dip switches for bosconm are wrong.



Brain ("brain")
===============
Known issues:
- This could be a bootleg. The ROM checksum test fails.
- The color PROMs are missing.



Break Thru ("brkthru")
======================
Keep 1 & 2 pressed and hit F3 to enter test mode, then hit 3 to proceed
through the tests.



Bubble Bobble ("bublbobl")
==========================
Clones supported:
  bootleg version called "Bobble Bobble" ("boblbobl")
  another bootleg, which has a dip switch setting for Super Bobble Bobble
    ("sboblbob")

Known issues:
- The original version is the only one where wizards throw stones.
- The protection feature which randomizes the EXTEND letters in the original
  version is not emulated properly.
- Service mode works only if Language is set to Japanese. This is not a bug,
  the original board does the same.



Bubbles ("bubbles")
===================
The first time you run the game, it will say "factory settings restored".
Press F2 to proceed.

F2 tests
F1+F2 bookkeeping/setup

Clones supported:
  "red label" version ("bubblesr")



Bump 'n Jump ("bnj")
====================
In test mode, press 3 to advance through the various tests.

Clones supported:
  Burnin' Rubber ("brubber") the service ROM is missing for this one so
    service mode doesn't work.
  bootleg called Car Action ("caractn") no service ROM here either

Known issues:
- The continue clock counts too fast



Burger Time ("btime")
=====================
In test mode, press 3 to advance through the various tests.

Clones supported:
  different ROM set, without Midway copyright and different attract mode
     ("btimed")
  same as above, but with two instructions NOPed out (function unknown)
     ("btimed2")
  Cook Race bootleg of the cassette version (different hardware and different

monitor is mostly informational, you might want to cut it out to enlarge the
play area. You can do that enforcing a suitable screen size. Good resolutions
are 400x300 (if your card supports it), or 800x600 with pixel doubling.

Known issues:
- When you die, a rectangle on the left of the screen blinks.

start a 2 players game with 7 lives each, insert two coins and press BUTTON 1.

Known issues:

starts up.

Clones supported:

Return of the jedi ("jedi")
===========================
Known issues:
- background graphics are blocky because the hardware which smoothes them is
  not emulated.
- this game has an analog stick. Control with keyboard or mouse doesn't work
  too well.



River Patrol ("rpatrolb")
=========================
Clones supported:
  Silver Land. Don't be fooled by the completely different graphics: this is
  the same game in disguise. ("silvland")

    during the demo ("robotryo")



Roc'n Rope ("rocnrope")
=======================
Clones supported:
  bootleg called Rope Man ("ropeman")

============================
Clones supported:
  alternate version, older ("rthundrb")

(set2), called 'old version' in japan.(1986/12)
(set1), called 'new version' in japan.(1987/1)
In 1987/1, All 'old version' romset changed 'new version' in amusement center.
because (i think) 'old version' was overdone that too hard difficulty game.



Rygar ("rygar")
===============
Clones supported:
  alternate version. This has a typo on the title screen: ALL RIGHT RESERVED
    instead of ALL RIGHT*S* RESERVED. ("rygar2")
  Japanese version ("rygarj")



Safari ("safari")
=================
Known issues:
- This game needs the overlay bad. The white rectangle on the screen is used
  to simulate the tree visible on the flyer.
  The flyer is at www.gamearchive.com/flyers/video/segagremlin/safari_b.jpg



Scion ("scion")
===============
Clones supported:
  Cinematronics license ("scionc")

Known issues:
- scion has some constant background noise. scionc doesn't. This might be due
  to a bad ROM.



Scramble ("scramble")
=====================
Known issues:
- The star background is probably not entirely accurate. Also, maybe it should
  be clipped at the top and bottom of the screen?



Sega Ninja ("seganinj")
=======================
Encrypted version

Clones supported:
  not encrypted version ("seganinu")
  Ninja Princess, which uses a different encryption ("nprinces")
  Ninja Princess, not encrypted ("nprincsu")
  Ninja Princess, bootleg?, using the Flicky encryption ("nprinceb")

Runs on almost the same hardware as Crazy Climber, but not exactly the same.

Known issues:
- Doesn't work well; for example, you always start with 99 lives, and coins
  are only accepted from coin C (default key: 5). It looks like there is a
  microcontroller on board, which is not emulated.

Keep start pressed to enter service mode.



Sidearms ("sidearms")
=====================

- Music tempo is too slow.



Sly Spy ("slyspy")
==================
Clones supported:
  alternate version (earlier) with one single different byte. ("slyspy2")



Snow Bros ("snowbros")
======================
Clones supported:
  alternate version, probably earlier ("snowbroa")

In snowbroa, you sometimes get a green potion that makes you invincible for a
few seconds (during which you can pass through walls and destroy any enemies
you touch). I looked at the GFX for this set vs snowbros and it appears that
only the snowbroa set has it.



Space Attack ("sspaceat")

Invaders hardware.

- Red screen "flash" when you die is not supported
- Background star field not supported. It is NOT a Galaxians type star field

Star Jacker ("starjack")
========================
Clones supported:
  Stern copyright ("starjacs")

The Stern version allows to play both in "multi" and "single" mode. The Sega
version is hardcoded for "multi" mode.

Known issues:
- Sprites in the Stern version might be wrong - I'm using the ROMs from the
  Sega version because the other ones were bad.



Star Wars ("starwars")
======================
Known issues:
- Dip switches not functional, but you can change game settings through
  the self test menus.
- Sometimes, after the TIE level, instead of zooming into the Death Star the
  game sits there endlessly.

=======================
Stern version

Clones supported:
  bootleg, probably of the Konami version, different ("stratgyb")

Known issues:
- Dip switches not verified, especially in the bootleg version



Subs ("subs")
=============
This game uses two monitors, one for each player, aimed away from each
other.  The emulation displays both monitors side by side on the screen.  A
lot of the challenge is lost when you can see both monitors.  Unfortunately,
there is no other simple solution to allow 2-player support on a
single-monitor computer.  Also, Subs is mildly dependent on its overlay.
Without the overlay, it might not be obvious that the playfield is circular
in shape, and the blinking white box actually illuminates a box labelled
"Sonar".



Super Basketball ("sbasketb")
=============================
Hold down Start 1 & Start 2 keys to enter test mode on start up;
then use Start 1 to advance to the next screen



Super Cobra ("scobra")
======================
Stern copyright.

Clones supported:
  Konami copyright ("scobrak")
  bootleg version ("scobrab")

Known issues:
- The star background is probably not entirely accurate. Also, maybe it should
  be clipped at the top and bottom of the screen?



Pang ("pang")
====================
Clones supported:
  bootleg version ("pangb")
  Buster Bros ("bbros")

The bootleg version contains opcodes and data decrypted separately, plus a few
patches here and there. They disabled sound in attract mode (there isn't a
setting to do that, unlike Buster Bros), changed the lives option from 1,2,3,4
to 1,3,4,6, and changed the copyright year from 1989 to 1990.



Super Pang ("spang")
====================
The first time you start the game, keep 1 pressed until you see the "SUPER
PANG 900914 ETC" screen, otherwise it won't initialize properly. This is
needed only the first time, the setup is saved to the EEPROM after that.



Super Punch Out ("spnchout")
============================
The game runs on two monitors, positioned one above the other. Since the top
monitor is mostly informational, you might want to cut it out to enlarge the
play area. You can do that enforcing a suitable screen size. Good resolutions
are 400x300 (if your card supports it), or 800x600 with pixel doubling.

Known issues:
- Doesn't work due to copy protection.



Super Qix ("superqix")
======================
Clones supported:
  bootleg version ("sqixbl")

Known issues:

- Sprite flipping is not emulated.
- Due to protection, the original version doesn't work. Use the bootleg instead.

========================
Known issues:
- The green flag has wrong colors (chequered green and black instead of full
  green).



Super Zaxxon ("szaxxon")
========================
Known issues:
- Several people complained that it runs too fast. This is not the case: a real
  board has been verified and it behaves the same. It's just insanely
  difficult.



Swimmer ("swimmer")
===================
Clones supported:
  alternate version ("swimmera")

Known issues:
- The side panel should be light green / blue ( turquoise ) throughout the
  game, not black as it is now.

Tempest ("tempest")
===================
Clones supported:
  version 2 ("tempest2")
  version 1 ("tempest1")
  Tempest Tubes ("temptube")

Known issues:
- Several people complained that mouse control is reversed. This is not the
  case. The more obvious place where this can be seen is the level selection
  screen at the beginning: move the mouse right, the block goes right.
  Anyway, if you don't like the key assignments, you can change them.



Terra Cresta ("terracre")
=========================
Clones supported:
  alternate version using YM2203 instead of YM3526 ("terracra")

- sound is quite wrong
- some sprites are displayed with wrong colors



Tin Star,The ("tinstar")
========================
Known issues:
- The aiming dial is emulated using a dual joystick setup.
- Collision detection is not emulated, therefore the barrels don't have any
  effect.
- There might be some misbehaviours caused by imperfect emulation of the 68705
  protection.
- Sprite priority glitches.



Toki ("toki")
=============
Known issues:
- The title screen is wrong



Tokio ("tokio")
===============
Clones supported:

Known issues:
- The original version doesn't work due to protection. Use the bootleg.

Note: the two revisions are quite different!



Track & Field ("trackfld")
==========================
Clones supported:
  Centuri license ("trackflc")
  Hyper Olympic ("hyprolym")
  Hyper Olympic bootleg which uses a 6802 + ADPCM samples instead of the
    VLM5030 speech chip ("hyprolyb")



Turbo Force ("turbofrc")
========================
Known issues:
- The front scrolling layer is completely wrong. You can see the title and
  American flag correctly only due to a hack. Everything else is wrong. The
  only explanation I have for this is a missing gfx ROM.
  To toggle the front layer off and on, press the space bar. You'll need to
  in later levels otherwise you won't see the background and some enemies.



Turkey Shoot ("tshoot")
=======================
The first time you run the game, it will say "factory settings restored".
Press F2 to proceed.

F2 tests
F1+F2 bookkeeping/setup



Turtle Ship ("turtship")
========================
Known issues:
- dip switches not mapped
- part of the gfx tiles are not used by the video driver, therefore the
  background is probably wrong in later levels.



Turtles ("turtles")
===================
Clones supported:
  Turpin ("turpin")
  600 (Konami version with different gameplay) ("600")

Known issues:
- Colors in 600 might be wrong.



Twin Cobra ("twincobr")
=======================
Clones supported:
  Romstar license ("twincobu")
  Kyukyoku Tiger ("ktiger")

Known issues:
- Most enemies appear already destroyed. This is probably caused by the
  incomplete emulation of the protection microcontroller.
- Kyukyoku Tiger doesn't boot.



Two Tigers ("twotiger")
=======================
Known issues:
- Two players not well supported



Us vs Them ("usvsthem")
=======================

=========================
Known issues:
- Probably due to copy protection, the game is not playable and resets often.



Wizard of Wor ("wow")
=====================
The original machine had a special joystick which could be moved either
partially or fully in a direction. Pushing it slightly would turn around the
player without making it move. The emulator assumes that you are always
pushing the joystick fully, to simulate the "half press" you can press Alt.



Wonder Boy ("wboy")
===================
Clones supported:
  alternate version - harder! ("wboy2")
  another version with different encryption ("wboy3")
  another version with different encryption. The music in this version is
    higher pitched. ("wboy4")
  same as above, but not encrypted. The sound ROM is the "standard" one, not
    the higher pitched one. ("wboy4u")
  unencrypted version, different from the others - earlier? ("wboyu")
  Wonder Boy Deluxe - this seems to be a bootleg of wboy4, it is not encrypted
    but is almost identical apart from removed ROM checksums and the "Energy
	Consumption" dip switch. ("wbdeluxe")

Known issues:
- I haven't decoded wboy3 yet.



World Cup 90 ("wc90")
=====================
Clones supported:
  bootleg version ("wc90b")

Known issues:
- No ADPCM samples.
- The second YM2203 starts outputting static after a few seconds. This is in
  the original version, the bootleg doesn't have a second YM2203.

Zaxxon ("zaxxon")
=================

There are no dip switches, press F1 to enter the service mode, then
  F1      Next screen
  F2      Next line
  F5      Up
  F6      Down

The first time you run the game, it will ask the location. You can change the
name using F5/F6 and F2, then F1 to proceed through all the configuration
screens, or just reset (F3).
